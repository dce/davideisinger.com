On Saturday, August 14th, we're taking the
[DevNation](http://devnation.us/) tour across the country for our first
ever stop in the Bay Area. Our friends at [Engine
Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/) will be hosting us for a day of talks,
hacking, and discussion. The lineup is our finest to date, featuring,
among others, speakers from [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/),
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/), [Basho](http://basho.com/), and
[Yahoo!](http://yahoo.com/) and capped off by a keynote from [Chris
Wanstrath](http://chriswanstrath.com/)
([defunkt](https://twitter.com/defunkt) of [GitHub](https://github.com/)
fame). As always, breakfast and lunch will be provided.

If you're in the Bay Area, we'd love to meet you. Registration is only
\$50 if you sign by this Saturday, so save your money for the happy hour
and [sign up now](http://devnation.us/events/9).
