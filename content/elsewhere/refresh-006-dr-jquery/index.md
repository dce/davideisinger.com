This past Thursday night saw the sixth meeting of [Refresh the
Triangle](http://refreshthetriangle.org/), the local chapter of the
Refresh tech network that Viget's helping to organize. [Nathan
Huening](http://onwired.com/about/nathan-huening/) from
[OnWired](http://onwired.com/) gave a great talk called "Dr. jQuery (Or,
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the DOM)," and his
passion for the material was evident. In a series of increasingly
complex examples, Nathan showed off the power and simplicity of the
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) JavaScript library. He demonstrated that
most of jQuery can be reduced to "grab things, do stuff," starting with
simple CSS modifications and moving to AJAX,
animation, and custom functionality.

To get a good taste of the presentation, you can use
[FireBug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) to run Nathan's [sample
code](http://dev.onwired.com/refresh/examples.js) against the [demo
page](http://dev.onwired.com/refresh/) he set up. You'll want to be
running [FireFox 2](http://www.getfirefox.com/), as FF3 Beta 5
gave me a lot of grief while I tried to follow Nathan's examples.

Big thanks to Nathan and to Duke's [Blackwell
Interactive](http://www.blackwell.duke.edu/) for hosting the event, as
well as to everyone who came out; maybe we've got you pictured on our

Hope to see you next month.
