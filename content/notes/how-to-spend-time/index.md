Broadly, three categories of productive activities:

* **Chores** -- things you have to do to maintain stasis.
  * [Sunday Firesides: To-Dos, the Rent We Pay For Living | The Art of Manliness][1]
* **Improving the world** -- not in some grand sense necessarily, but activities that create lasting improvement: building things, fixing things, getting rid of things.
  * [What Do You Want to Make Real in the World? — Anna Havron][2]
* **Improving yourself** -- things you do to make you better at doing other things.

> Book smarts, street smarts. Learning by study, learning by doing.
> Read about it, apply it, see it in action, take that practical experience
> back to your reading, deepen your understanding, take that deeper
> understanding back to your activity ... it's a never-ending cycle, each
> aspect of learning feeding the other.

> Information becomes _knowledge_ -- personal, embodied, verified -- only when we put it to use ...
> Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfulling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others -- by inspiring, entertaining, or educating them.

_(This would imply that "improving yourself" is the most valuable use of time, but I actually think it's something like the opposite.)_

Experiences:

* Routine
* Novel

Leisure:

* Most of my hobbies are hard (satisfying but somewhat stressful)
* I don't really have leisure activities besides reading fiction
* I spend a lot of time mindlessly scrolling my phone
* What do I love to do that is relaxing & that I don't feel a constant need to improve at?
* [Spend Exactly None Of Your Time Killing Time][7]

Sleep:

* Getting 7+ hours is important. It can feel like a waste of time when it's 11:30 and you're on a roll, but an extra hour of sleep can mean the difference between a good day and a bad one.
* If you're tired mid-day, just take a nap.

> Napping makes you smarter. Seriously. Lots of studies show napping improves alertness and cognitive performance in the af noon. As usual, we've tested the science ourselves.
>
> You don’t even have to fall asleep. Just lying down and resting for ten to twenty minutes can be a great way to recharge.
