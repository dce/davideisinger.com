Broadly, three categories of productive activities:

* **Chores** -- things you have to do to maintain stasis.
  * [Sunday Firesides: To-Dos, the Rent We Pay For Living | The Art of Manliness][3]
* **Improving the world** -- not in some grand sense necessarily, but activities that create lasting improvement: building things, fixing things, getting rid of things.
  * [What Do You Want to Make Real in the World? — Anna Havron][4]
* **Improving yourself** -- things you do to make you better at doing other things.

> Book smarts, street smarts. Learning by study, learning by doing.
> Read about it, apply it, see it in action, take that practical experience
> back to your reading, deepen your understanding, take that deeper
> understanding back to your activity ... it's a never-ending cycle, each
> aspect of learning feeding the other.

Experiences:

* Routine
* Novel

Leisure:

* Most of my hobbies are hard (satisfying but somewhat stressful)
* I don't really have leisure activities besides reading fiction
* I spend a lot of time mindlessly scrolling my phone

Sleep:

* Getting 7+ hours is important. It can feel like a waste of time when it's 11:30 and you're on a roll, but an extra hour of sleep can mean the difference between a good day and a bad one.
* If you're tired mid-day, just take a nap.

> Napping makes you smarter. Seriously. Lots of studies show napping improves alertness and cognitive performance in the af noon. As usual, we've tested the science ourselves.

> You don’t even have to fall asleep. Just lying down and resting for ten to twenty minutes can be a great way to recharge.
