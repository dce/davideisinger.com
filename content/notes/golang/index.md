I find [Go][1] really compelling, even though it's not super applicable to my job. When evaluating a new tool, I find I'm weirdly biased to things written in Go.

* I like that it compiles, and have no desire to install someone else's Python
* It just seems to hit the right balance of productivity, performance, simplicity, safety
* The language (and the tech built with the language) just seems built to last
