### Thoughts on priorities in software development

* So much stuff doesn't work -- bugs stop you from accomplishing your desired task
* Over time, complexity creeps in, making changes gets harder
* The focus on performance, serverless, microservices, etc. -- these increase complexity, reduce reliability
* Everyone agrees that the current status quo sucks, but we disagree on the solution: go back to how things worked in the past, or continue down the path we're on with the hope that things will improve
  * Reference ["Second-guessing the modern web"][1] and ["In defense of the modern web"][2]
