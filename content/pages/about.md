I'm a technologist living in Durham, North Carolina, USA with my wife and daughter, plus a dog named Steve and a parrot named Tad.

My parents met at IBM and I grew up around computers (my favorite was the [PS/2 Model P70][1]). We were online pretty early, first with [Prodigy][2] and AOL, then moving onto the web. I started making websites in middle school (a few I made in high school are [still][3] [online][4] as of March 2024). I interned at [webMethods][5] for two summers and saw both sides of the original web bubble. I studied Computer Science in college and have been making stuff for the web professionally ever since.

I work as a developer and manager at [Viget][6], where I've been since 2008. Ruby is my primary language, but I enjoy working across a variety of technologies. I'm super interested in Golang these days.

In my free time, I enjoy running, cycling, woodworking, making [music][7], and creative programming.

## Colophon

This site is built with [Hugo][12]. I recommend Brian P. Hogan's [_Build Websites with Hugo_][13] if you'd like to set up your own Hugo site from first principles.

It's deployed via GitHub Actions to a small Digital Ocean server running behind Cloudflare. I use [Caddy][14] in a Docker container to serve the site.

Image dithering is handled via a small webservice I've detailed in [a dedicated post][15].

The links on the homepage are pulled from my [Pinboard bookmarks][16]. I create plaintext backups of pages I link to with [w3m][17].

I manage my [monthly dispatch emails][18] with [Listmonk][19], also running as a container behind a Caddy proxy.

Source code is available on [sourcehut][20].
