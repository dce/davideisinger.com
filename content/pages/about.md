I'm a technologist living in Durham, North Carolina, USA with my wife and daughter, plus a dog named Steve and a parrot named Tad.

I work as a developer and manager at [Viget][1], where I've been building things for the web since 2008. Ruby is my primary language, but I enjoy working across a variety of technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy running, cycling, woodworking, making [music][2], and creative programming.

## Colophon

This site is built with [Hugo][7]. I recommend Brian P. Hogan's [_Build Websites with Hugo_][8] if you'd like to set up your own Hugo site from first principles.

It's deployed via GitHub Actions to a small Digital Ocean server running behind Cloudflare. I use [Caddy][9] in a Docker container to serve the site.

Image dithering is handled via a small webservice I've detailed in [a dedicated post][10].

The links on the homepage are pulled from my [Pinboard bookmarks][11]. I create plaintext backups of pages I link to with [w3m][12].

I manage my [monthly dispatch emails][13] with [Listmonk][14], also running as a container on the same server.
Source code is available on [GitHub][15].
