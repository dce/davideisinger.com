We were down at Lake Norman for the long weekend, and as I was pulling up the kayaks this morning, I couldn't help but feel like I was also sort of putting away the summer -- what a summer though. The last few weeks of August were pretty wall-to-wall. I went up to the Eastern Shore in Virginia to spend a long weekend with some old friends. Our rental was right on an inlet off the Chesapeake, and they had a stand-up paddleboard I was able to take out.

The following weekend, we headed up to Rehoboth Beach in Delaware to spend the week with my family. It's different than the North Carolina beaches we're used to as there's a lot to do around the town (boardwalk, parks & playgrounds, [indoor amusement park][1]). We brought our bikes and took a ride on the [Gordons Pond Trail][2], which was rad.

We also recorded this little jam featuring my 3.5-year-old niece on the melodica:

From there, we drove 400 miles to Greensboro, and then onto Lake Norman to spend Labor Day weekend with Claire's family, a relaxing way to cap off an eventful summer.

As one might imagine, this involved a lot of driving, and to pass the hours and miles, I tried something new: listening to audio books. [My local library][3] has a good selection which integrates with the Libby app. I listened to:

* [_The Left Hand of Darkness_][4] by Ursula K. Le Guin. I've enjoyed some of her other stuff and have meant to read this for years. Great story & narration, highly recommended.
* [_With a Mind to Kill_][5] by Anthony Horwitz, a James Bond novel. This one got me through that long drive I mentioned a minute ago. I didn't love this -- the Craig movies did a good job bringing Bond into the modern era, and I felt like the author was trying to be faithful to the Fleming books, which meant treating the female characters poorly. The narrator, Rory Kinner, was great and has a [cool Bond connection][6].

I also started a [low-brow thriller][7] and was surprised that it was the same narrator as _Left Hand_; [I guess this guy records a lot of audio books][8].

We got hit with a [nasty storm][9] in the middle of August. It was wild -- hot, sunny day during my scoot home, then 5 minutes later, hard rain/thunder/80mph winds. We were without power from 4pm until 8pm the following day, and the damage through the city was intense. Phones weren't working very well, traffic lights were out, and even places that had power were cash-only as the credit card systems were down. Fortunately, we have a good set of camping equipment, most of which doubles as disaster preparedness gear, but it made plain the fragility of modern society.
