We were down at Lake Norman for the long weekend, and as I was pulling up the kayaks this morning, I couldn't help but feel like I was also sort of putting away the summer. What a summer though. The last few weeks of August were pretty wall-to-wall. I went up to the Eastern Shore in Virginia to spend a long weekend with some old friends; our rental was right on an inlet off the Chesapeake, and they had a stand-up paddleboard I was able to take out, certainly the most fun I've ever had on one of those.

The following weekend, we headed up to Rehoboth Beach in Delaware to spend the week with my family. We love it up there; it's different than the North Carolina beaches we're used to with an old-school board walk, [indoor amusement park][1], (...something...). We all brought our bikes up and were able to take them out to [Gordons Pond][2], which was rad.

We also recorded this little jam featuring my 3.5-year-old niece on the melodica:

From there, we drove 400 miles to Greensboro, and then onto Lake Norman to spend Labor Day weekend with Claire's family, a relaxing way to cap off an eventful summer.

As one might imagine, this involved a lot of driving, and to pass the hours and miles, I tried something new: listening to audio books. I listen to podcasts fairly regularly, but with my running schedule being as it is, I'm running short on fresh content. At the recommendation of a friend, I wanted to read _The Left Hand of Darkness_ by Ursula K. Le Guin, and [my local library][3] had a recording of it available on Overdrive/Libby.

* _The Left Hand of Darkness_
* _With a Mind to Kill_
  * The narrator, Rory Kinner, was great and has a [cool Bond connection][4]
* _The Survivor_

[I guess this guy records a lot of audio books.][5]
