* Closet progress: done!
  * Get a photo (finish it first)
* Biking: installed trailer hitch; now need to select + purchase rack
* Read [_Building a Second Brain_][6]
  * Tried a couple PKM apps
  * Settled on [Obsidian][7] (for now -- may just end up back in Vim at some point)
  * I like the idea of [Logseq][8], but the editing experience had some warts and I didn't love being forced into an outline format
  * Obsidian seems nice if a little non-native
  * Set up the [web clipper][9] which is cool
  * Need to figure out sync
  * Also started keeping [public notes][10]
* Didn't write any go, but started a [notes page][11]
* JCC
* TTT
  * Tides Inn
  * Scooter
* Having a kid is the end of "what if" thinking.
