* Closet progress
  * done!
  * Get a photo (finish it first)
* Biking
  * Installed trailer hitch
  * Now need to select + purchase rack
* Read [_Building a Second Brain_][1]
  * Tried a couple <abbr title="personal knowledge management">PKM</abbr> apps
  * Settled on [Obsidian][2] (for now -- may just end up back in Vim at some point)
  * I like the idea of [Logseq][3], but the editing experience had some warts and I didn't love being forced into an outline format
  * Obsidian seems nice if a little non-native
  * Set up the [web clipper][4] which is cool
  * Need to figure out sync
  * Also started keeping [public notes][5]
* Didn't write any go, but started a [notes page][6]
  * This is the risk of getting to into PKM, I suppose
* [JCC][7]
  * Pool
  * Gym
* TTT
  * 15 years!
  * [Tides Inn][8]
  * [Scooter][9]
* Having a kid is the end of "what if" thinking.
