* [Why I don't use Copilot][3]

  > I enjoy programming because it’s about reasoning, thinking, models, concepts, expression, communication, ethics, reading, learning, making, and process. It’s an art and a practice that is best done with other people.
  >
  > Increasingly I think it’s imperative for programming to be done more slowly, more deliberatively, and as part of more conversations with more people. The furious automation of everything is eating the world.

* [Phase change][4]

  > *What could I do with a universal function — a tool for turning just about any X into just about any Y with plain language instructions?*
  >
  > I don’t pose that question with any sense of wide-eyed expectation; a reason­able answer might be, *eh, nothing much*. Not every­thing in the world depends on the trans­for­ma­tion of symbols. But I think that IS the question, and I think it takes some legit­i­mate work, some strenuous imagination, to push yourself to believe it really will be “just about any X” into “just about any Y”.

* [The looming demise of the 10x developer: Why an era of enthusiast programmers is coming to an end][5]

  > That is to say, I’ve come to believe the era typified by the enthusiast programmer—autodidactic, obsessive, and antisocial—is drawing to a close.

* [Notes on Conflict | Yes, Mike will do.][6]

  > Over time I shifted on the matter a little, but when I look back on it I realize I wasn’t really evolving my attitude toward conflict, I was just evolving my response to its existence, while still believing that being in a state of conflict is a problem. I just got better at keeping my blood pressure low and gritting through it. I think I was looking at conflict as a thing that you have to acknowledge exists, but that you need to get through as quickly as possible, because it’s a bad place to be.
