March was great -- took a two night/one day work retreat, spent a weekend out in the woods with the family, had my annual trip to Las Vegas, and participated in Viget's [Pointless Week][1]. Also got to spend some quality time with Nevie; she's a great kid and it's amazing to see her personality come out.

In April, I'm finishing training for (and then running) the [Tar Heel 10 Miler][2], and heading down to Lake Norman for the first time in 2023. Hoping to get Claire on an e-bike this month, as well (eyeing the [Aventon Pace 500.3][3]).

I didn't make much progress on the closet project this month (took some measurements and had some discussions with Claire), but I did manage to build this "learning tower" for Nev and started acquainting myself with Affinity Designer.

This month:

* Adventure: Catawba River kayaking ([route][4])
* Project: closet shelves (again)
* Skill: [Go][5] -- every time I find a new tool I'm excited about, it's written in Go. Seems about time to learn it and make something.
