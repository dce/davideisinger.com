Busy March! My whole family came into town for a long weekend, then we headed down to Wilmington to run a race and spend time with Claire's sister, then I was off to Vegas for the basketball tournament, and we capped things off at Lake Norman with Claire's grandmother.

We had such a good time at the race [last month][1] that we all decided to sign up for the [Steve Haydu St. Patrick's Lo Tide Run][2]. I didn't do quite as well ([results][3], [certificate][4]) but I had a great time and I got to catch the last mile or so of the 5K with Claire and Nev (my tiny runner).

I picked up a [Roland SP-404][5] sampler -- this thing's super neat. It gives me something I can plug a guitar or microphone into, has a bunch of built-in effects, and plays nicely with the Novation Circuit Tracks (I can trigger samples with the MIDI sequencer, and I can run sound from the Circuit to the SP-404 to add effects). Here's a track I made with them called "Asperatus":

I added some shelves to my existing workbench to hold all my music gear. Feeling pretty good about this setup assuming I don't buy anything else (ðŸ˜¬ yeah right).

I read a bunch of great books this month. The standout was certainly [_Sea of Tranquility_][6] by Emily St. John Mandel (read [_The Glass Hotel_][7] first). I also enjoyed [_Tress of the Emerald Sea_][8] -- classic Sanderson shit.

I had a couple things printed this month. I made this [e-ink photo frame][9] a couple years back, and for the second year in a row, I sent all the photos off to [Mixbook][10] for a run of full-color, hardcover books I sent to my family. The frame's lasted longer than I anticipated, but these'll last longer. Also, most of my musical equipment provides its documentation as digital PDFs instead of printed manuals. I sent the PDFs for the Circuit Tracks and the SP-404 off to [print-my-pdf.com][11] and got back nice, wire-bound printed copies. I've made it about half way through the Circuit manual and learned a bunch already, something I'd never do w/ a 100+ page PDF on my computer. As Manuel Moreale says in a [recent post][12]:

> The more we digitize the world the more analogue, physical objects become important.

This month:

* Adventure: Claire and I are headed to Lisbon, Portugal for a long weekend; hoping to catch a [Benfica][13] match while we're there
* Project: declutter and organize -- gotta clear out some space for some big stuff coming this summer
* Skill: SP-404 -- so much to learn here (recording tight samples, selectively applying effects, resampling, etc.)

[13]: https://www.slbenfica.pt/en-us/

Reading:

* Fiction: [_Pawn of Prophecy_][14], David Eddings (recommended by [Wouter Groeneveld][15])
* Non-fiction: aforementioned Circuit and SP-404 manuals
