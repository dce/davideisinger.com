TOMORROW IS THE DAY we welcome baby brother to the world, and I wanted to get this out before everything changes. I'm excited, for sure, but bringing a baby into the world is a major thing and I'm anxious for Claire. The joy can come after, once everyone's emerged healthy.

We had a great month with Nev. Highlights included a trip to the lake, the [Running of the Bulls 8K][1], and the [Beaver Queen Pagent][2]. I want to say it was our best month so far, though that might just be preemptive nostalgia, since this is the last month she gets 100% of our attention. But she's just such a fun little person. I couldn't been more proud of her.

Here's some new music:

<audio controls src="/journal/dispatch-16-june-2024/Asperitas.mp3"></audio>

This was fun to make -- a couple iPad synths connected to my Circuit Tracks, running into the SP-404 for effects, with my MIDI keyboard to add some wobble to the main synth line. I recorded this all in one take, which is not how most people make music like this, but it has a fun, performative aspect to it. I've also spent time trying to learn the SP-404 in earnest -- it is a neat, complex machine.

### This Month

* Adventure: BABY BRO
* Project: building stuff for our house during paternity leave (art table, indoor treehouse)
* Skill: SP-404, baby swaddling

### Reading

* Fiction: [_Enchanter's End Game_][3], David Eddings
* Non-fiction: [_The 12 Week Year_][4], Brian P. Moran & Michael Lennington (I like the concept but it's pretty fluffy)

### Links

I don't have anything great this month but I recommend [Baldur Bjarnason][5], [Tim Hårek][6] and [Installer][7] on the Verge for interesting links -- they always seem to find good stuff.
