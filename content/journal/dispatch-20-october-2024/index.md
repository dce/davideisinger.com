Note: I'm trying to get back to posting these in the first couple days of the month, so this dispatch only covers the last two weeks.

I turned 42 this month (apparently I have a [very common birthday][1]). [_Hitchhiker's Guide_ aside][2], 42 doesn't seem a particularly important milestone, but it _is_ the product of six and seven, and so 42 represents the end of my seventh six-year cycle, which is an interesting way to think about the phases of life.

* 0-6: early childhood
* 6-12: elementary school
* 12-18: middle + high school
* 18-24: college + first job
* 24-30: my 20s; started at Viget
* 30-36: late single-dude period
* 36-42: family man

What will the next six-year cycle bring? Hopefully more of the same. Life is grand.

To celebrate, we headed to Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, which was a **scene**. Nevie loved Dollywood and visiting with her grandparents, and we enjoyed some time at Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

Nico started daycare last week, which is bittersweet; it's been wonderful having him around all day. But we love our daycare and it's fun to have him and Nev in the same place.

Just a few more weeks until my half-marathon. I'm feeling relatively good, hitting my mileage goals though dismayed with my pace on the longer runs. I'm trying to make time to run while it's light out -- I don't think running in the dark after a long day is doing me any favors.

Finished a couple small house projects: added a hanging system for Nev's art table and built some storage for our reusable grocery bags.

... If I run, it was a good day, and I feel the same way about these little home improvement efforts: any day I get to use a drill or power saw is a good day. It's something about the self-directed decision making, skill, and agency of it ...

### Reading

* Fiction: [_House of Assassins_][5], Larry Correia -- this series isn't blowing my mind but at this point I'm invested enough that I'll see the whole thing through
* Non-fiction: [_The World Beyond Your Head_][6], Matthew B. Crawford -- this is really very good and speaks to me at a deep level; a little dense if you (like me) don't read a lot of academic writing but highly recommended regardless

    > You have to imagine a life you can live with, where you are, when you are. If you don’t, you’ll never be satisfied. Neither AI nor anything else is coming to save you from the things you don’t like about being a person. The better life you absolutely can build isn’t going to be brought to you by ChatGPT but by your own steady uphill clawing and through careful management of your own expectations. You live here. This is it. That’s what I would tell to everyone out there: this is it. This is it. This is it. You’re never going to hang out with Mr. Data on the Holodeck. I know that, for a lot of people, mundane reality is everything they want to escape. But it could be so much worse.

    > I think that even the most overhyped technology usually delivers some benefit to the world. And often succeeds quietly, long after the hype has died. Recent examples include 3D printing, which has found massive success in prototyping, medical applications - a friend had a filling 3D-printed right in his doctor’s office - and niche consumer items. Etsy is awash with 3D printed lamps, some even that I own. Or drones, which are now used all the time in news coverage, on job sites, and by people filming themselves hiking.
