Another month in the books. Man, year's flying by. We filled it up though: went down to the lake for Easter weekend, took the kayaks out on the Catawba. Claire went out to California to visit a friend, so I got to spend a lot of one-on-one time with Nev and made a big dent in the closet project. The first unit is done and installed. Claire seems really happy with it. The second unit should go a lot quicker since most of the thought work is done.

I ordered Claire an [e-bike][1] thinking it might arrive before her birthday mid-May, but it showed up just a few days later. It's been a blast taking Nevie to the museum and around town. We also ran the Tar Heel 10 Miler last weekend. Super fun, and I did better than I expected to based on my training ([result][2], [certificate][3]) -- there's something about an organized race that just gives that extra push I guess.

This month:

* Adventure: do some non-electric biking ("acoustic biking" as it were), ideally after getting a rack installed on the car
* Project: finish this closet off
* Skill: gonna say learning Golang again, though the fact that I'm struggling to pick a project makes me think my interest is more theoretical than practical

Reading:

* Fiction: [_Long Shadows_][4], David Baldacci
* Non-fiction: [_Building a Second Brain_][5], Tiago Forte
  * _Looks like the author did a [podcast][6] I should check out_
