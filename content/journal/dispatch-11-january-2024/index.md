That's a wrap on 2023. Our little Nevie turned two in December. It's hard to imagine her changing as much in the next year as she did in the last, but I suppose it's inevitable. We spent Christmas at Claire's folks' house in Greensboro and hit up both the [Greensboro Children's Museum][1] and [Greensboro Science Center][2].

* Cleaning up basement
	* Getting shit out of house
	* New shelves
	* Making space for an office + music/hobby station

I also dusted off the Switch to play [Dead Cells][3]. It's similar to [Hades][4] but in a more retro side-scrolling format. Highly recommended if you don't mind dying a lot.
