That's a wrap on 2023. Our little Nevie turned two in December. It's hard to imagine her changing as much in the next year as she did in the last, but I suppose it's inevitable. We spent Christmas at Claire's folks' house in Greensboro and hit up both the [Greensboro Children's Museum][1] and [Greensboro Science Center][2].

We're on a bit of a purge, trying to free up some space in the house. It's an overwhelming project (how did we acquire so much stuff?) but we're taking it one step at a time. I've been building new shelves and put up [guitar hangers][3] to clear up some floor space. I've taken inspiration from [this post about office organization][4] and [this one about maintaining a list of where to find things][5].

Music-wise, I received an [Arturia KeyStep 37][6] as a Christmas gift from my in-laws. This thing is super nice; I'm already having a blast using it to play my existing gear, and I'm hoping it'll play a big role as I shift to a more computer-based workflow. Here's a new track called "Orographic":

I also dusted off the Switch to play [Dead Cells][7]. It's similar to [Hades][8] but in a more retro side-scrolling format. Highly recommended if you don't mind dying a lot.

This month:

* Adventure: spending MLK weekend with my folks in a cabin the Shenandoah Valley, probably take Nev to [Luray Caverns][9]
* Project: music/hobby table -- **no new gear** until I have a place I can actually use the stuff I have (then probably a [Roland Juno][10] as a reward)
* Skill:
