We spent MLK weekend with my folks in the Shennandoah Valley, and visited [Luray Caverns][1], something I'd done as a kid and still rips 30 years later. Neat place, highly recommended if you're ever in that area. We also got some snow at our cabin, which was pretty fun for Nev.

I signed up for the [Wrightsville Beach Valentine Run][2] 10K in Wilmington in early February, which has added a little bit of focus to my running without the commitment of half-marathon training and gives us a good excuse to spend a weekend with Claire's sister in Wilmington. Might try to keep that going, finding organized 10Ks in places we want to visit.

I stumbled on [this article][3] ([via][4]) about an iOS feature that periodically updates your lock screen to a random photo of a selected person. It is ... delightful.

Here's a new track called "Altocumulus":

<audio controls src="/journal/dispatch-12-february-2024/Altocumulus.mp3"></audio>

I really set out to make a track that didn't have a bass hit on one and three and snare on two and four, but some things you just can't resist, though you can tell I tried for the first 90 seconds or so. I also found a [really nice app][5] for practicing scales -- Apple catches a lot of shit (perhaps deservedly so) for its app store policies, but it's a pretty cool thing that I can so easily find quality software like this at a fair price.

I traded a couple emails with my buddy [Prayash][6]. He's a super talented musician (among other things) and has a new track out called ["Weightless"][7] that's worth a listen. He also put a [video on Instagram][8] of his production process which is neat.

I installed [these crossbars][9] on our car in the hopes that we can avoid replacing it with something bigger for a while longer. I get a real kick out of DIY upgrades and fixes like this -- using your brain and hands to adapt the things you have to better suit your needs is so, so satisfying. Fellow Durham blogger [Christopher Butler][10] put up a [good post][11] that speaks to this same idea:

> One thing I hope my children learn is to nurture the balance of curiosity, creativity, and willingness to mess-up that is needed to make the world your own while you’re here.

Couple security updates: my favorite [TOTP][12] app, Raivo, [got bought up by a shady-looking company][13], so I switched over to to [2FAS][14]. Super smooth onboarding experience, and I actually prefer its authentication flow (browser plugin ➡️  push notification ➡️  Face ID ➡️  accept ➡️  autofill). Also, I listened to [a podcast][15] some months back that described the damage a thief can do with a stolen iPhone, so when I learned about this new [Stolen Device Protection][16] feature, I enabled it immediately.

I finished [_Revenge: Eleven Dark Tales_][17] and decided to stay on the short story collection train with [_Story of Your Life and Others_][18].

I try to keep plaintext backups of the things I link to on this site, at least the text-heavy stuff I might want to refer to later (you can see them down below in the "references" section). I'd been using [Lynx][19] to get the text, but that was having issues on some sites, so I switched over to [w3m][20] after finding the right command-line flag[^1] to include link URLs in the text. I've got some ideas around building a more robust archiving solution but I'm gonna let it marinate for a bit.
