We spent the week of Thanksgiving with my sister near Albany, New York.

It was great for Nevie to get some extended time with her cousins.

In what's now I guess an annual tradition, I ran a 10K the morning of Thanksgiving, this time the [Troy Turkey Trot][1]. I felt great, and I'm happy with my time ([results][2], [certificate][3]). Claire joked that someone once told her that after you run a marathon, a half-marathon becomes your favorite race distance. That's how I feel about 10Ks -- it's like the first half of a half-marathon, before it really starts to suck.

I spent few evenings building a tool to keep Markdown links in order, which I've called `mdrenum`. I documented the process thoroughly in a [separate post][4]. Super fun to make and quite useful for writing these posts. It's up on [GitHub][5] if you're interested.

I bought a [201 Pocket Piano][6] after seeing it on [Bonobo's gear list][7] so that I could make some music while we were traveling. This thing is cool! Great sounds and patterns, MIDI in/out, battery powered and a built-in speaker. The company that makes it releases new synths pretty regularly, and it's super straightforward to swap them out -- just plug it into your computer, hit a couple keys, and it shows up as a drive.

Here's a new track I made with it, called "Cirrus" (keeping with the cloud theme):

I published a few other things this month: ["Maintenance Matters: Good Tests"][8] on my company blog ([mirrored here][9]). I also had to do a company-wide presentation and ended up just doing a gift guide of things we own and recommend. Doesn't seem worth a standalone post (this is not that sort of website) but I did [copy the list into a note][10].
