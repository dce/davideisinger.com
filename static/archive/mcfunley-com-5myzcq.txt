    [5]Choose Boring Technology
    March 30th, 2015

   Probably the single best thing to happen to me in my career was having
   had [6]Kellan placed in charge of me. I stuck around long enough to see
   Kellan’s technical decisionmaking start to bear fruit. I learned a
   great deal from this, but I also learned a great deal as a result of
   this. I would not have been free to become the engineer that wrote
   [7]Data Driven Products Now! if Kellan had not been there to so
   thoroughly stick the landing on technology choices.
   [FRQKLCy.jpg] Being inspirational as always.

   In the year since leaving Etsy, I’ve resurrected my ability to care
   about technology. And my thoughts have crystallized to the point where
   I can write them down coherently. What follows is a distillation of the
   Kellan gestalt, which will hopefully serve to horrify him only
   slightly.

      Embrace Boredom.

   Let’s say every company gets about three innovation tokens. You can
   spend these however you want, but the supply is fixed for a long while.
   You might get a few more after you achieve a [8]certain level of
   stability and maturity, but the general tendency is to overestimate the
   contents of your wallet. Clearly this model is approximate, but I think
   it helps.

   If you choose to write your website in NodeJS, you just spent one of
   your innovation tokens. If you choose to use [9]MongoDB, you just spent
   one of your innovation tokens. If you choose to use [10]service
   discovery tech that’s existed for a year or less, you just spent one of
   your innovation tokens. If you choose to write your own database, oh
   god, you’re in trouble.

   Any of those choices might be sensible if you’re a javascript
   consultancy, or a database company. But you’re probably not. You’re
   probably working for a company that is at least ostensibly
   [11]rethinking global commerce or [12]reinventing payments on the web
   or pursuing some other suitably epic mission. In that context, devoting
   any of your limited attention to innovating ssh is an excellent way to
   fail. Or at best, delay success [13][1].

   What counts as boring? That’s a little tricky. “Boring” should not be
   conflated with “bad.” There is technology out there that is both boring
   and bad [14][2]. You should not use any of that. But there are many
   choices of technology that are boring and good, or at least good
   enough. MySQL is boring. Postgres is boring. PHP is boring. Python is
   boring. Memcached is boring. Squid is boring. Cron is boring.

   The nice thing about boringness (so constrained) is that the
   capabilities of these things are well understood. But more importantly,
   their failure modes are well understood. Anyone who knows me well will
   understand that it’s only with a overwhelming sense of malaise that I
   now invoke the spectre of Don Rumsfeld, but I must.
   [n8ElWr3.jpg] To be clear, fuck this guy.

   When choosing technology, you have both known unknowns and unknown
   unknowns [15][3].
     * A known unknown is something like: we don’t know what happens when
       this database hits 100% CPU.
     * An unknown unknown is something like: geez it didn’t even occur to
       us that [16]writing stats would cause GC pauses.

   Both sets are typically non-empty, even for tech that’s existed for
   decades. But for shiny new technology the magnitude of unknown unknowns
   is significantly larger, and this is important.

      Optimize Globally.

   I unapologetically think a bias in favor of boring technology is a good
   thing, but it’s not the only factor that needs to be considered.
   Technology choices don’t happen in isolation. They have a scope that
   touches your entire team, organization, and the system that emerges
   from the sum total of your choices.

   Adding technology to your company comes with a cost. As an abstract
   statement this is obvious: if we’re already using Ruby, adding Python
   to the mix doesn’t feel sensible because the resulting complexity would
   outweigh Python’s marginal utility. But somehow when we’re talking
   about Python and Scala or MySQL and Redis people [17]lose their minds,
   discard all constraints, and start raving about using the best tool for
   the job.

   [18]Your function in a nutshell is to map business problems onto a
   solution space that involves choices of software. If the choices of
   software were truly without baggage, you could indeed pick a whole mess
   of locally-the-best tools for your assortment of problems.
   Created with Sketch. Problems Technical Solutions The way you might
   choose technology in a world where choices are cheap: "pick the right
   tool for the job."

   But of course, the baggage exists. We call the baggage “operations” and
   to a lesser extent “cognitive overhead.” You have to monitor the thing.
   You have to figure out unit tests. You need to know the first thing
   about it to hack on it. You need an init script. I could go on for days
   here, and all of this adds up fast.
   Created with Sketch. Problems Technical Solutions The way you choose
   technology in the world where operations are a serious concern (i.e.,
   "reality").

   The problem with “best tool for the job” thinking is that it takes a
   myopic view of the words “best” and “job.” Your job is keeping the
   company in business, god damn it. And the “best” tool is the one that
   occupies the “least worst” position for as many of your problems as
   possible.

   It is basically always the case that the long-term costs of keeping a
   system working reliably vastly exceed any inconveniences you encounter
   while building it. Mature and productive developers understand this.

      Choose New Technology, Sometimes.

   Taking this reasoning to its reductio ad absurdum would mean picking
   Java, and then trying to implement a website without using anything
   else at all. And that would be crazy. You need some means to add things
   to your toolbox.

   An important first step is to acknowledge that this is a process, and a
   conversation. New tech eventually has company-wide effects, so adding
   tech is a decision that requires company-wide visibility. Your
   organizational specifics may force the conversation, or [19]they may
   facilitate developers adding new databases and queues without talking
   to anyone. One way or another you have to set cultural expectations
   that this is something we all talk about.

   One of the most worthwhile exercises I recommend here is to consider
   how you would solve your immediate problem without adding anything new.
   First, posing this question should detect the situation where the
   “problem” is that someone really wants to use the technology. If that
   is the case, you should immediately abort.
   [rmdSx.gif] I just watched a webinar about this graph database, we
   should try it out.

   It can be amazing how far a small set of technology choices can go. The
   answer to this question in practice is almost never “we can’t do it,”
   it’s usually just somewhere on the spectrum of “well, we could do it,
   but it would be too hard” [20][4]. If you think you can’t accomplish
   your goals with what you’ve got now, you are probably just not thinking
   creatively enough.

   It’s helpful to write down exactly what it is about the current stack
   that makes solving the problem prohibitively expensive and difficult.
   This is related to the previous exercise, but it’s subtly different.

   New technology choices might be purely additive (for example: “we don’t
   have caching yet, so let’s add memcached”). But they might also overlap
   or replace things you are already using. If that’s the case, you should
   set clear expectations about migrating old functionality to the new
   system. The policy should typically be “we’re committed to migrating,”
   with a proposed timeline. The intention of this step is to keep
   wreckage at manageable levels, and to avoid proliferating
   locally-optimal solutions.

   This process is not daunting, and it’s not much of a hassle. It’s a
   handful of questions to fill out as homework, followed by a meeting to
   talk about it. I think that if a new technology (or a new service to be
   created on your infrastructure) can pass through this gauntlet
   unscathed, adding it is fine.

      Just Ship.

   Polyglot programming is sold with the promise that letting developers
   choose their own tools with complete freedom will make them more
   effective at solving problems. This is a naive definition of the
   problems at best, and motivated reasoning at worst. The weight of
   day-to-day operational [21]toil this creates crushes you to death.

   Mindful choice of technology gives engineering minds real freedom: the
   freedom to [22]contemplate bigger questions. Technology for its own
   sake is snake oil.

   Update, July 27th 2015: I wrote a talk based on this article. You can
   see it [23]here.
     __________________________________________________________________

    1. Etsy in its early years suffered from this pretty badly. We hired a
       bunch of Python programmers and decided that we needed to find
       something for them to do in Python, and the only thing that came to
       mind was creating a pointless middle layer that [24]required years
       of effort to amputate. Meanwhile, the 90th percentile search
       latency was about two minutes. [25]Etsy didn't fail, but it went
       several years without shipping anything at all. So it took longer
       to succeed than it needed to.
    2. We often casually refer to the boring/bad intersection of doom as
       “enterprise software,” but that terminology may be imprecise.
    3. In saying this Rumsfeld was either intentionally or unintentionally
       alluding to [26]the Socratic Paradox. Socrates was by all accounts
       a thoughtful individual in a number of ways that Rumsfeld is not.
    4. A good example of this from my experience is [27]Etsy’s activity
       feeds. When we built this feature, we were working pretty hard to
       consolidate most of Etsy onto PHP, MySQL, Memcached, and Gearman (a
       PHP job server). It was much more complicated to implement the
       feature on that stack than it might have been with something like
       Redis (or [28]maybe not). But it is absolutely possible to build
       activity feeds on that stack.
       An amazing thing happened with that project: our attention turned
       elsewhere for several years. During that time, activity feeds
       scaled up 20x while nobody was watching it at all. We made no
       changes whatsoever specifically targeted at activity feeds, but
       everything worked out fine as usage exploded because we were using
       a shared platform. This is the long-term benefit of restraint in
       technology choices in a nutshell.
       This isn’t an absolutist position--while activity feeds stored in
       memcached was judged to be practical, implementing full text search
       with faceting in raw PHP wasn't. So Etsy used Solr.
