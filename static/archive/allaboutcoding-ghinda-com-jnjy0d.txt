Technical review

Ruby and Rails version

   They are currently using:
     * Ruby version 3.2.2
     * They used a fork of Rails at [30]https://github.com/feedbin/rails
       forked from [31]https://github.com/Shopify/rails. They are using a
       branch called [32]7-1-stable-invalid-cache-entries - It seems to be
       Rails 7.1 and about 1 month behind the Shopify/rails which is
       usually pretty up to date with main Rails

Architecture

   Code Architecture:
     * They are using the standard Rails organisation of MVC.

   Database:
     * The DB is PostgreSQL

   Jobs queue:
     * Sidekiq

   On the front-end side:
     * They use .html.erb
     * They are using Phlex for [33]components
     * They are using [34]Jquery for the JS library
     * They have some custom JS code written in [35]CoffeeScript
     * They are using Hotwire via [36]importmaps
     * They are using [37]Tailwind

Stats

   Running /bin/rails stats will output the following:

   Running VSCodeCounter will give the following stats:

Style Guide

   For Ruby:
     * They are using [38]standardrb as the Style Guide with no
       customisations.

Storage, Persistence and in-memory storage

   The DB is PostgreSQL.

   They are not using the schema.rb but the [39]structure.sql format for
   DB schema dump is configured via application.rb:
module Feedbin
    class Application < Rails::Application
        # other configs
        config.active_record.schema_format = :sql
        # other configs
    end
end

   Enabled PSQL extensions:
     * hstore - "data type for storing sets of (key, value) pairs"
     * pg_stat_statements - "track planning and execution statistics of
       all SQL statements executed"
     * uuid-ossp - "generate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs)"

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS hstore WITH SCHEMA public;
COMMENT ON EXTENSION hstore IS 'data type for storing sets of (key, value) pairs
';

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements WITH SCHEMA public;
COMMENT ON EXTENSION pg_stat_statements IS 'track planning and execution statist
ics of all SQL statements executed';


CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp" WITH SCHEMA public;
COMMENT ON EXTENSION "uuid-ossp" IS 'generate universally unique identifiers (UU
IDs)';

   Redis is configured to be used with Sidekiq.

   This is what the [40]redis initializer looks like:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/config/initializers/redis.rb#L1

defaults = {connect_timeout: 5, timeout: 5}
defaults[:url] = ENV["REDIS_URL"] if ENV["REDIS_URL"]

$redis = {}.tap do |hash|
  options2 = defaults.dup
  if ENV["REDIS_URL_PUBLIC_IDS"] || ENV["REDIS_URL_CACHE"]
    options2[:url] = ENV["REDIS_URL_PUBLIC_IDS"] || ENV["REDIS_URL_CACHE"]
  end
  hash[:refresher] = ConnectionPool.new(size: 10) { Redis.new(options2) }
end

   Further, there is a [41]RedisLock configured like this:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/models/redis_lock.rb#L1

class RedisLock
  def self.acquire(lock_name, expiration_in_seconds = 55)
    Sidekiq.redis { _1.set(lock_name, "locked", ex: expiration_in_seconds, nx: t
rue) }
  end
end

   Further down this is used in a [42]clock.rb (that defines scheduled
   tasks to run):
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/lib/clock.rb#L8

every(10.seconds, "clockwork.very_frequent") do
  if RedisLock.acquire("clockwork:send_stats:v3", 8)
    SendStats.perform_async
  end

  if RedisLock.acquire("clockwork:cache_entry_views", 8)
    CacheEntryViews.perform_async(nil, true)
  end

  if RedisLock.acquire("clockwork:downloader_migration", 8)
    FeedCrawler::PersistCrawlData.perform_async
  end
end

every(1.minutes, "clockwork.frequent") do
  if RedisLock.acquire("clockwork:feed:refresher:scheduler:v2")
    FeedCrawler::ScheduleAll.perform_async
  end

  if RedisLock.acquire("clockwork:harvest:embed:data")
    HarvestEmbeds.perform_async(nil, true)
  end
end

every(1.day, "clockwork.daily", at: "7:00", tz: "UTC") do
  if RedisLock.acquire("clockwork:delete_entries:v2")
    EntryDeleterScheduler.perform_async
  end

  if RedisLock.acquire("clockwork:trial_expiration:v2")
    TrialExpiration.perform_async
  end

  if RedisLock.acquire("clockwork:web_sub_maintenance")
    WebSub::Maintenance.perform_async
  end
end

Code & Design Patterns

Code Organisation

   Under /app there are 3 folders different from the ones that Rails comes
   with:
     * presenters
     * uploaders
     * validators

   The lib folder includes very few extra objects. Most of them seems to
   be related to communicating with external services.

   Maybe worth mentioning from lib folder is the
   [58]ConditionalSassCompressor
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/lib/conditional_sass_compressor.r
b#L1

class ConditionalSassCompressor
  def compress(string)
    return string if string =~ /tailwindcss/
    options = { syntax: :scss, cache: false, read_cache: false, style: :compress
ed}
    begin
      Sprockets::Autoload::SassC::Engine.new(string, options).render
    rescue => e
      puts "Could not compress '#{string[0..65]}'...: #{e.message}, skipping com
pression"
      string
    end
  end
end

   This is used to configure:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/config/application.rb#L47
config.assets.css_compressor = ConditionalSassCompressor.new

Routes

   There is a combination of RESTful routes and non-restful routes.

   Here is an example from entries in the [59]routes.rb :
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/config/routes.rb#L133

  resources :entries, only: [:show, :index, :destroy] do
    member do
      post :content
      post :unread_entries, to: "unread_entries#update"
      post :starred_entries, to: "starred_entries#update"
      post :mark_as_read, to: "entries#mark_as_read"
      post :recently_read, to: "recently_read_entries#create"
      post :recently_played, to: "recently_played_entries#create"
      get :push_view
      get :newsletter
    end
    collection do
      get :starred
      get :unread
      get :preload
      get :search
      get :recently_read, to: "recently_read_entries#index"
      get :recently_played, to: "recently_played_entries#index"
      get :updated, to: "updated_entries#index"
      post :mark_all_as_read
      post :mark_direction_as_read
    end
  end

Controllers

   The controllers are mostly what I would call vanilla Rails controllers.

   Three notes about them:
     * Some of them are responding with JS usually using USJ or JQuery to
       change elements from the page.
     * They contain non-Rails standard actions (actions that are not show,
       index, new, create ...)
     * There is a namespaced api folder that contains APIs used by mobile
       apps

   Here is one simple example for DELETE /entries/:id , the controller
   looks like this:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/controllers/entries_controlle
r.rb#L238
  def destroy
    @user = current_user
    @entry = @user.entries.find(params[:id])
    if @entry.feed.pages?
      EntryDeleter.new.delete_entries(@entry.feed_id, @entry.id)
    end
  end

   And here is the view [60]destroy.js.erb :
$('[data-behavior~=entries_target] [data-entry-id=<%= @entry.id %>]').remove();

feedbin.Counts.get().removeEntry(<%= @entry.id %>, <%= @entry.feed_id %>, 'unrea
d')
feedbin.Counts.get().removeEntry(<%= @entry.id %>, <%= @entry.feed_id %>, 'starr
ed')
feedbin.applyCounts(true)

feedbin.clearEntry();
feedbin.fullScreen(false)

   The main pattern adopted to controllers is to have some logic in them
   and delegate to jobs some part of the processing.

   The repo contains mostly straight-forward controllers like this one:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/controllers/pages_internal_co
ntroller.rb#L1
class PagesInternalController < ApplicationController

  def create
    @entry = SavePage.new.perform(current_user.id, params[:url], nil)
    get_feeds_list
  end
end

   But also few controllers that include some logic:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/controllers/api/podcasts/v1/f
eeds_controller.rb#L8

 def show
  url = hex_decode(params[:id])
  @feed = Feed.find_by_feed_url(url)
  if @feed.present?
    if @feed.standalone_request_at.blank?
      FeedStatus.new.perform(@feed.id)
      FeedUpdate.new.perform(@feed.id)
    end
  else
    feeds = FeedFinder.feeds(url)
    @feed = feeds.first
  end

  if @feed.present?
    @feed.touch(:standalone_request_at)
  else
    status_not_found
  end
rescue => exception
  if Rails.env.production?
    ErrorService.notify(exception)
    status_not_found
  else
    raise exception
  end
end

   Even with this structure, I find all controllers easy to read and I
   think they can be easier to change.

Models

   The app/models folders contain both ActiveRecord and normal Ruby
   objects. With few exceptions, they are not namespaced.

Jobs

   The jobs folder contains Sidekiq jobs which are used to do processing
   on various objects. They are usually called from controllers and most
   of them are async.

   Here is one job that is caching views:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/jobs/cache_entry_views.rb#L1

class CacheEntryViews
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  include SidekiqHelper

  SET_NAME = "#{name}-ids"

  def perform(entry_id, process = false)
    if process
      cache_views
    else
      add_to_queue(SET_NAME, entry_id)
    end
  end

  def cache_views
    entry_ids = dequeue_ids(SET_NAME)
    entries = Entry.where(id: entry_ids).includes(feed: [:favicon])
    ApplicationController.render({
      partial: "entries/entry",
      collection: entries,
      format: :html,
      cached: true
    })
    ApplicationController.render({
      layout: nil,
      template: "api/v2/entries/index",
      assigns: {entries: entries},
      format: :html,
      locals: {
        params: {mode: "extended"}
      }
    })
  end
end

Presenters

   There is a [61]BasePresenter and all other presenters are extending it
   via inheritance:

   This controller defines a private method called presents:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/presenters/base_presenter.rb#
L1

class BasePresenter
  def initialize(object, locals, template)
    @object = object
    @locals = locals
    @template = template
  end

  # ...

  private

  def self.presents(name)
    define_method(name) do
      @object
    end
  end
end

   and it is used like this for example:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/presenters/user_presenter.rb#
L2

class UserPresenter < BasePresenter
  presents :user
  delegate_missing_to :user

  # ... more code

  def theme
    result = settings["theme"].present? ? settings["theme"] : nil
    result || user.theme || "auto"
  end
  # ... other code
end

   To use the presenters, there is a helper defined in ApplicationHelper
   will instantiate the proper helper based on the object class:
module ApplicationHelper
  def present(object, locals = nil, klass = nil)
    klass ||= "#{object.class}Presenter".constantize
    presenter = klass.new(object, locals, self)
    yield presenter if block_given?
    presenter
  end

  # more code ...
end

   and it is used [62]like this in views:
<% present @user do |user_presenter| %>
    <% @class = "settings-body settings-#{params[:action]} theme-#{user_presente
r.theme}"%>
<% end %>

ApplicationComponents

   Components are based on Phlex and they inherit from
   [63]ApplicationComponent

   It defines a method to add Stimulus controller in components like this:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/views/components/application_
component.rb#L25

  def stimulus(controller:, actions: {}, values: {}, outlets: {}, classes: {}, d
ata: {})
    stimulus_controller = controller.to_s.dasherize

    action = actions.map do |event, function|
      "#{event}->#{stimulus_controller}##{function.camelize(:lower)}"
    end.join(" ").presence

    values.transform_keys! do |key|
      [controller, key, "value"].join("_").to_sym
    end

    outlets.transform_keys! do |key|
      [controller, key, "outlet"].join("_").to_sym
    end

    classes.transform_keys! do |key|
      [controller, key, "class"].join("_").to_sym
    end

    { controller: stimulus_controller, action: }.merge!({ **values, **outlets, *
*classes, **data})
  end

   Where we can also see a bit of hash literal omission at {controller:
   stimulus_controller, action: }

   But more interesting that this method that helps defining a Stimulus
   controller, is the method used to define a Stimulus item that uses
   binding to get variables from the object where it is used:
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/app/views/components/application_
component.rb#L47

  def stimulus_item(target: nil, actions: {}, params: {}, data: {}, for:)
    stimulus_controller = binding.local_variable_get(:for).to_s.dasherize

    action = actions.map do |event, function|
      "#{event}->#{stimulus_controller}##{function.to_s.camelize(:lower)}"
    end.join(" ").presence

    params.transform_keys! do |key|
      :"#{binding.local_variable_get(:for)}_#{key}_param"
    end

    defaults = { **params, **data }

    if action
      defaults[:action] = action
    end

    if target
      defaults[:"#{binding.local_variable_get(:for)}_target"] = target.to_s.came
lize(:lower)
    end

    defaults
  end

   The part with binding does the following:
     * stimulus_controller =
       binding.local_variable_get(:for).to_s.dasherize This line retrieves
       the value of the local variable for, converts it to a string, and
       then applies the dasherize method (presumably to format it for use
       in a specific context, like a CSS class or an identifier in HTML).
     * Apparently binding.local_variable_get should not be needed as the
       variable is passed a keyword parameter to the method. But the name
       of the variable is for which is a reserved word and thus if the
       code would have been stimulus_controller = for.to_s_dasherize that
       would have raised syntax error, unexpected '.' (SyntaxError)

   This is a way to have keyword arguments named as reserved words and
   still be able to use them.

ComponentsPreview

   All components can be previewed via Lookbook and they can be found in
   test/components

Testing

   For testing it uses Minitest, the default testing framework from Rails.
   It uses fixtures to set up the test db.

   Tests are simple and direct, containing all preconditions and
   postconditions in each test. This is great for following what each test
   is doing.

   There are controller tests, model tests, job tests and some system
   tests. There are more controller tests than system tests making the
   test suite run quite fast. Also the jobs are covered pretty good with
   testing as there is a log of logic in the jobs.

Custom assertions

   There are some custom assertions created specifically to work with
   collections: assert_has_keys will check if all keys are included in the
   hash and assert_equal_ids will check if the two collections provided
   have the same ids (one being a collection of objects and the other one
   being a hash).
# https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin/blob/main/test/support/assertions.rb#L3

    def assert_has_keys(keys, hash)
      assert(keys.all? { |key| hash.key?(key) })
    end

    def assert_equal_ids(collection, results)
      expected = Set.new(collection.map(&:id))
      actual = Set.new(results.map { |result| result["id"] })
      assert_equal(expected, actual)
    end

Conclusion

   In conclusion, Feedbin is an open-source project that combines RSS
   feeds and newsletters into a convenient platform.

   It utilizes Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Sidekiq, and various other
   technologies to provide a robust and efficient service.

   The code is well-organized and simple to follow the logic and what is
   happening. I think it will make it easy for anyone to contribute to
   this repo. If you want to run this yourself locally you should take a
   look at the [64]feedbin-docker.
