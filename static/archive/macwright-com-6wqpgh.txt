Crypto's missing plateau of productivity

2024-09-15

I think that even the most overhyped technology usually delivers some benefit
to the world. And often succeeds quietly, long after the hype has died. Recent
examples include 3D printing, which has found massive success in prototyping,
medical applications - a friend had a filling 3D-printed right in his doctor’s
office - and niche consumer items. Etsy is awash with 3D printed lamps, some 
[10]even that I own. Or drones, which are now used all the time in news
coverage, on job sites, and by people filming themselves hiking.

I suspect that even if Augmented Reality doesn’t take off, it’ll leave in its
wake big advances in miniaturized projectors, improved optics, and scene
understanding algorithms in computer vision and ML. The internet of things
didn’t really work and most people’s Alexa speakers are only used for setting
alarms, but the hype-wave did justify the deployment of much-needed
technologies like IPv6, Zigbee, and BLE.

So, the thought is: none of this applies to crypto. It didn’t work, and it also
didn’t fund the development of any lasting technological advance. There’s no
legacy. The crypto industry’s research didn’t create new foundations for
building decentralized databases. Next-generation cryptography kept rolling on,
and, as far as I know, none of it owes much to the cryptocurrency industry.
Nothing new has been discovered about economics: as Matt Levine says, [11]“One
thing that I say frequently around here is that crypto keeps learning the
lessons of traditional finance at high speed.” It’s hard to name anything of
value that came out of this hype wave. We incinerated all that investment, and
randomly redistributed some wealth, and… what else?

The best I can come up with is the popularization of [12]zero-knowledge proofs,
which play some role in Zerocash and Ethereum but are a fundamental advance in
security and have other applications.

Maybe there’s something I’m missing? But it reminds me of [13]the end of Burn
After Reading: “What did we learn? We learned not to do it again.”
