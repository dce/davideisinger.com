Own Your Web – Issue 12: Finding Your Rhythm

[1] [fcc8dc79-0]

Own Your Web

Hi All! 🤗

It is one of the most common reasons why we abandon our personal sites and
blogs: at some point, we stop publishing.

But why? Weren’t we so enthusiastic when we started (or restarted) our sites?
Didn’t we tell ourselves that this time, we would really post more regularly?
And didn’t it also work well for a few posts? But then, everyday life
interfered. Other things needed our attention. And before we knew it, two
months had passed since our last post. Then four, then eight… And, just like
with other habits, once you let the series break and more and more time has
passed since your last post, it is getting even harder to publish again.

You would be right in pointing out that that’s part of the beauty of having a
personal site. You are free to decide how regularly you post and there is no
obligation to post anything. You don’t owe the world or the people out there
any posts, after all.

But then again, what is the point of having a personal site if we don’t [2]put
stuff out there from time to time, if we don’t document and share random
thoughts, things we learned, and nuggets we found? And even though you
definitely don’t have to publish daily to enjoy having a blog, it is only when
you post more regularly that many of [3]the advantages of having a personal
site really start to emerge.

One key to posting regularly lies in finding your very own cadence of writing,
a habitual practice that works well for you personally and that fits your
lifestyle and comfort. For some of us, this means finding set hours for
writing. Maybe it becomes your morning ritual, a quiet moment to collect your
thoughts and transpose them before the day’s demands grab your attention. Or
perhaps you're more of a night writer, documenting your day’s thoughts and
ideas when the world around you has slowed down. Or maybe, you just need to
give yourself permission to jot down a quick first draft of a post whenever you
have an idea throughout the day, taking advantage of the momentum when it is
still fresh. Still others like to batch-write a few articles in advance in
longer, uninterrupted sessions on certain days of the week or when they are
traveling, for example. Whatever works for you, in the end it all comes down to
making writing or working on your site something that you do consistently and
repeatedly, maybe even daily.

If you establish this consistent rhythm, you will find that over time, it will
become much more frictionless to publish new posts and you’ll leave the
resistance behind. Now, the rhythm of your writing habit is the beat that
carries you. You’ll also have more ideas on what to write about, because your
brain is constantly watching for opportunities for future posts. And you’ll
learn to not wait for inspiration to strike but to sit down and get past the
inertia of those first few words, because you can trust in your ability to work
your way through even [4]the shittiest first drafts.

At the same time, it is equally important to not overthink the process of
writing and publishing in the first place. It is your site, so you are allowed
to post regardless of what others think of it or how polished it is. It is
still a blog, not an academic journal and nobody expects a blog post to have
Pulitzer-winning quality. Perfect is an illusion. So just put stuff out there
and experiment. And if it is only for yourself.

And then, there’s a third secret to publishing more regularly, and that’s
enjoying the process of creating something and making it really convenient and
frictionless to publish. Above all, working and posting on your website should
be fun. Your CMS, SSG, or other tools you are using are an import factor in how
enjoyable and easy it is to post new things. If every new post takes a huge
amount of work besides the pure writing, it adds unnecessary friction and makes
the whole process more cumbersome. If, on the other hand, drafting and
publishing a post is almost as smooth as writing a post on social media, there
is not much between your thoughts and the next published post. This will allow
you to enjoy the act of creating itself even more and you will much more likely
find that rhythm that works for you – and keep publishing on your site.

What writing habit or publishing cadence have you found to work best for you?

Kottke.org Redesigns With 2024 Vibes

I already shared another post about the recent redesign of kottke.org in the
last issue, but I didn’t want to withhold this interesting post by [7]Jason
himself, in which he explains a lot of the decisions that influenced the new
design with all it’s 2024 “social media energy”.

CSS :has() Interactive Guide

The CSS :has selector is now supported [9]in all major browsers (yes, also in
Firefox) and [10]Ahmad took the opportunity to create another one of his
amazing interactive explainer posts. This time, he explains :has() and also
provides a ton of useful examples of how to use it in clever ways, not only as
a parent selector.

Talker’s block

An all time classic by [12]Seth Godin about why no one ever gets talker’s block
and why precisely therein lies the cure for writer’s block:

    “Just write poorly. Continue to write poorly, in public, until you can
    write better.”

No one ever gets talker’s block. No one wakes up in the morning, discovers he
has nothing to say and sits quietly, for days or weeks, until the muse hits,
until the moment is right, until all…

What the world needs

A beautiful piece by [14]Jeremy about writing, why sharing your experience is
always valuable, and the right response to the assertion that “the world
doesn’t need another opinion.”
