   You went through the ‘[9]Tour of Go’, played with
   [10]https://play.golang.org/ and you feel you are ready to write some
   code. Great! However, you are not sure how to structure your projects.
   Can you put your code anywhere you want? Is there a standard way to
   organize your code? What if you need to have multiple application
   binaries? What does it mean to be ‘go gettable’? These are some of the
   questions you’ll be asking yourself.

   First, you have to understand Go workspaces. ‘[11]How to Write Go Code’
   is a good place to start. By default, Go keeps and expects all code in
   a single workspace. This place is identified by the GOPATH environment
   variable. What does it mean for you? It means you have to put your code
   in the default workspace or you have to change the GOPATH variable to
   point to your own location. Either way the actual source code for your
   project needs to be placed in the src subdirectory (e.g.,
   $GOPATH/src/your_project or
   $GOPATH/src/github.com/your_github_username/your_project). Technically
   your project doesn’t have to be in a workspace if you don’t import
   external packages and you use relative imports for your own code, but
   it’s not recommended. It’s fine for a toy project or a PoC though. Go
   v1.11 does introduce the concept of [12]modules that allows you to have
   your project code outside of your GOPATHwithout the import restrictions
   mentioned above, but it’s still an experimental feature at this point
   in time.

   You have your project directory in the right place. What’s next?

   For a PoC or a very small project where you are the only one writing
   the code using a single main.go file in the root directory for your
   project is enough. If you know your project will be large enough or
   it’ll go into production and others will be contributing to it you
   should consider adopting, at least, some of the project layout patterns
   outlined here.

   There are a number of project layout patterns emerging in the Go
   ecosystem. The two most common patterns are the cmd and pkg
   directories. You should adopt these patterns unless you have a tiny
   project.

   The cmd layout pattern is very useful when you need to have more than
   one application binary. Each binary gets a subdirectory (e.g.,
   your_project/cmd/your_app). This patterns also helps you keep your
   project/package ‘go gettable’. What does it mean? It means you can use
   the go get command to fetch (and install) your project, its
   applications and its libraries (e.g., go get
   github.com/your_github_username/your_project/cmd/appxg). You don’t have
   to separate the application files. You’ll be able to build each
   application with the right set of go build flags, but go get will no
   longer work because it will not know which application code to build.
   The official [13]Go tools is one example of the cmd layout patter. A
   number of other well known projects use the same pattern:
   [14]Kubernetes, [15]Docker, [16]Prometheus, [17]Influxdb.

   The pkg layout pattern is also pretty popular. For new Go developers
   it’s one of the most confusing package structure concepts because Go
   workspaces have a directory with the same name and that directory has a
   different purpose (it’s used to store object files for the packages the
   Go compiler builds). The pkg directory is where you put your public
   libraries. They can be used internally by your application. They can
   also be used by external projects. This is an informal contract between
   you and other external users of your code. Other projects will import
   these libraries expecting them to work, so think twice before you put
   something here. Many well known projects use this pattern:
   [18]Kubernetes, [19]Docker, [20]Grafana, [21]Influxdb, [22]Etcd.

   Some of the libraries in the pkg directory are not always for public
   use. Why is that? It happens because many existing Go projects predate
   the ability to hide internal packages. Some projects put those internal
   libraries in the pkg directory to be consistent with the rest of their
   code structure. Other projects put their internal libraries into
   separate directories outside of the pkg directory. [23]Go 1.4 introduce
   an ability to hide code using internal directories. What does it mean?
   If you put your code in an ‘internal’ directory no external project
   will be able to import that code. Even other code in your project won’t
   be able to access this internal code if it lives outside of its parent
   directory. This feature is not widely used yet because it’s relatively
   new; however, it’s extremely valuable as an additional layer of control
   (in addition to the lowercase and uppercase function visibility rules
   in Go). A number of new and well known projects use this pattern:
   [24]Dep, [25]Docker, [26]Nsq, [27]Go Ethereal, [28]Contour.

   The internal directory is the place to put your private packages. You
   can optionally add additional structure by separating your internally
   shared libraries (e.g., your_project/internal/pkg/your_private_lib) and
   the application code you don’t want others to import (e.g.,
   your_project/internal/app/your_app). When you put all of you private
   code in the ‘internal’ directory the application code in the cmd
   directory will be limited to small files that define the ‘main’
   function for the corresponding application binaries. Everything else
   will be imported from the internal or pkg directories ([29]ark, from
   Heptio, and [30]loki, from Grafana, are good examples of this tiny main
   package pattern).

   What if you forked and modified a piece of an external project? Some
   projects put that code in the pkg directory, but it’s better to put it
   in the third_party top level directory to keep your code separate from
   the code you borrowed from others.

   What about the external packages you import in your projects? Where do
   they go? You have several options. You can keep them outside of your
   project. The packages you install with go get will be saved in your Go
   workspace. It works most of the times, but depending on the package it
   might be brittle and unpredictable because when somebody else tries to
   build your project they might get a backward incompatible version of
   that package. The solution is ‘vendoring’. With ‘vendoring’ you freeze
   your dependencies by committing them with your project. [31]Go 1.6
   introduced a standard way to ‘vendor’ external packages (it was an
   experimental feature in Go 1.5). Put your external package in the
   vendor directory. How is this different from the third_party directory?
   If you import and use external code as-is then it should go into the
   vendor directory. If you are using a modified version of an external
   project then put it in the third_party directory.

   If you want to learn more about the project structure used by other Go
   projects read the ‘[32]Analysis of the Top 1000 Go Repositories’. It’s
   a little dated, but it’s still useful.

   A real project will have additional directories too. You can use this
   layout template as a starting point for your Go projects:
   [33]https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout. It covers the
   Go project layout patterns described in this blog post and it includes
   a number of supporting directories you’ll need to have.

   Now it’s time to write some code! If you don’t have Go installed take a
   look at this [34]quick setup guide for Mac OS X (setup on other
   platforms is similar). Go through the ‘[35]Tour of Go’ if you haven’t
   done it yet and then read ’[36]50 Shades of Go’ to learn about the most
   common gotchas in Go, which will save you quite a bit of time when you
   start writing and debugging code.
