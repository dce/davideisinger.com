Why keep writing?

Good question.

I guess a natural follow up question is: Why did you start in the first place?

Also a good question. Let's try it:

 1. "Writing to learn": I believe that writing is a great way to learn.

 2. It sorts floating thoughts somewhere. Sure, could be private notes. Could
    be a physical notepad. Could be a lot, but since I make web pages for a
    living, that also seems like a good solution.

 3. Practice. I really believe writing is a core skill that never goes out of
    date, and always will be relevant. And writing a blog trains that writing
    muscle.

 4. Learning to let go. Clicking that "publish" button might not mean much.
    After all, I can most probably count on one hand the readers of this post.
    Still, it feels like a massive hurdle. And because "[5]caring less what
    others think" is a personal goal of mine, writing and pressing publish
    aligns well with that. The uncomfort is just proof that I still care too
    much.

Ok, so that's at least something.

Not a great list, but enough to keep me at it for now.
