The small town is the nearest place to the mainland

   Cavo is a beach resort, fully equipped for tourists, with a sandy beach
   that goes as far as Capo Castello, where there are the remains of a
   [98]Roman villa from the first century AD, and a beautiful coastline of
   cliffs that goes from Capo Castello to Capo della Vita.

   The small port is the nearest place to the mainland, and has water and
   refuelling facilities for pleasure boats. In 1849, Giuseppe Garibaldi
   stopped there on his way to the Island of Caprera.

   You can also admire the [99]Tonietti Mausoleum here; it is a unique,
   liberty style building that stands out above the wild vegetation on the
   island, and was designed by the architect Adolfo Coppedè
   (Florence 1871 - Montemurlo 1951) on behalf of the Tonietti family who
   wanted a sepulchral chapel. The Toniettis were the first
   concessionaires of the iron mines on the eastern side of Elba after the
   unification of Italy. Coppedè is known for the Via Dora area in Rome.
