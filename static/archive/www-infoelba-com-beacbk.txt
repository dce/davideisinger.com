The small town is the nearest place to the mainland

[o_cavo_dro]

Cavo is a beach resort, fully equipped for tourists, with a sandy beach that
goes as far as Capo Castello, where there are the remains of a [122]Roman villa
from the first century AD, and a beautiful coastline of cliffs that goes from
Capo Castello to Capo della Vita.

The small port is the nearest place to the mainland, and has water and
refuelling facilities for pleasure boats. In 1849, Giuseppe Garibaldi stopped
there on his way to the Island of Caprera.

You can also admire the [123]Tonietti Mausoleum here; it is a unique, liberty
style building that stands out above the wild vegetation on the island, and was
designed by the architect Adolfo Coppedè (Florence 1871 - Montemurlo 1951) on
behalf of the Tonietti family who wanted a sepulchral chapel. The Toniettis
were the first concessionaires of the iron mines on the eastern side of Elba
after the unification of Italy. Coppedè is known for the Via Dora area in Rome.
