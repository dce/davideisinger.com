History of Funland

   [ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=]

It all started as an innocent vacation to the beach, back in 1961…

   Allen and Don Fasnacht, their wives Jean and Dee, and their parents Al
   and Sis visited the place that was to become Funland during a trip to
   the Delaware seashore in August of 1961.

   At the time, the family was operating a small “picnic park” near
   Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, called Willow Mill Park.  Being the park
   people that they were, they visited the Rehoboth Beach Sports Center,
   as it was called when the Dentino family owned it.  While they were
   talking about the ins and outs of the park business with Mr Dentino, he
   asked if they might be interested in buying the Sports Center.  Yeah
   right, was the thought not spoken, but that was going through the
   Fasnachts’ minds.  Mr. Dentino affirmed that he was indeed interested
   in selling the business and that the Fasnachts should think about
   buying it.

   Think about it is exactly what the family did when they returned home.
    It became a recurring topic in the Fasnacht family.  They called Mr.
   Dentino and decided to go through with the purchase.

   By March 1962 everything was falling into place, but so was an unusual
   area of low pressure off the East Coast.  This storm never developed
   into a hurricane but was the lowest pressure system ever recorded for
   the area.  Settlement on the park was to be on March 15, 1962.  The
   Great Atlantic Storm hit on March 6th, devastating the entire eastern
   seacoast.  The Fasnacht family traveled down from Hershey, and the
   Dentino family came up from Florida to assess the situation.  Both
   families agreed to go ahead with the deal after they worked out an
   allowance for the damage.

   The rest is history: expanding the park here and there, adding rides
   and games, and buying adjoining properties for the growing family and
   their children.  From the original 1st and 2nd generation, there are
   now over twenty 3rd and 4th generation family members who are directly
   involved with the business. They, along with over ten 5th generation
   members coming up closely behind them, are all continuing that heritage
   that began half a century ago!
