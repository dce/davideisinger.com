History of Funland

[ACwAAAAAAQ]

It all started as an innocent vacation to the beach, back in 1961…

Allen and Don Fasnacht, their wives Jean and Dee, and their parents Al and Sis
visited the place that was to become Funland during a trip to the Delaware
seashore in August of 1961.


At the time, the family was operating a small “picnic park” near Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, called Willow Mill Park.  Being the park people that they were,
they visited the Rehoboth Beach Sports Center, as it was called when the
Dentino family owned it.  While they were talking about the ins and outs of the
park business with Mr Dentino, he asked if they might be interested in buying
the Sports Center.  Yeah right, was the thought not spoken, but that was going
through the Fasnachts’ minds.  Mr. Dentino affirmed that he was indeed
interested in selling the business and that the Fasnachts should think about
buying it.


Think about it is exactly what the family did when they returned home.  It
became a recurring topic in the Fasnacht family.  They called Mr. Dentino and
decided to go through with the purchase.


By March 1962 everything was falling into place, but so was an unusual area of
low pressure off the East Coast.  This storm never developed into a hurricane
but was the lowest pressure system ever recorded for the area.  Settlement on
the park was to be on March 15, 1962.  The Great Atlantic Storm hit on March
6th, devastating the entire eastern seacoast.  The Fasnacht family traveled
down from Hershey, and the Dentino family came up from Florida to assess the
situation.  Both families agreed to go ahead with the deal after they worked
out an allowance for the damage.


The rest is history: expanding the park here and there, adding rides and games,
and buying adjoining properties for the growing family and their children.
 From the original 1st and 2nd generation, there are now over twenty 3rd and
4th generation family members who are directly involved with the business.
They, along with over ten 5th generation members coming up closely behind them,
are all continuing that heritage that began half a century ago!
