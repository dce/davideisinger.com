Wealth = Have ÷ Need

2024-09-27

Not a new idea, but just another visualization and reminder.

Wealth, feeling like you have plenty, is an equation.

Wealth = Have ÷ Need

If you have nothing, then focus on having some.

Once you have some, the easiest way to increase your wealth is to decrease your
needs.

Have 10 but think you need 100? You are poor.

Have 10 but only need 5? You are wealthy.

Have 10 but are happy with 1? You are very wealthy.

Making money depends on other people, so it’s harder. It’s not entirely under
your control. It’s an outer game.

Reducing what you need is easier. It’s entirely under your control. It’s an
inner game.

I used to look for ways to make money, but I haven’t done that in years. Now I
keep looking for ways to need less and want less.
