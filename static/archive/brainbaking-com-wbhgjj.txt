                           Favorites of December 2023

   [9]1 January 2024

   Happy New Year! Hopefully 2024 will bring the needed peace and solace
   to everyone. 2023 was a very difficult year for us, with lots of what
   you might call “low lows” and a few “high highs”. We usually make fun
   of that saying, but this seems like the first time it’s appropriate to
   use it.

   As far as blogging goes, 2023 was a great year. See the Brain Baking
   [10]blog post archive for 2023: with 90 posts last year, that’s on
   average 7.5 a month or 1.875 a week. The best part about 2023 in
   blogging was the feedback I got, and the new friends and e-mail pen
   pals I made. As frequently mentioned before, [11]blogging keeps on
   giving. If there’s one thing I never ever intend to give up, it’s
   blogging.

   The following posts turned out to be the most popular of 2023:
    1. [12]FPGAs And The Renaissance of Retro Hardware
    2. [13]Overlooked Reasons To Still Buy Physical Media
    3. [14]Goodbye, ProtonMail
    4. [15]Phomemo Thermal Printing On MacOS
    5. [16]DOOM Turned Thirty

   As for Jefklak’s Codex, the most popular article was the one on
   [17]Freaky Trip, a bizarre (and very buggy) single-screen
   adventure/puzzle game. That one got a few hits simply because I
   couldn’t find any reviews online myself! As far as visitor counts go,
   the Codex gets almost none, but I still have a lot of fun filling it.
   It’s my own thing, and I’ve pondered on that subject recently in [18]On
   Writing For Yourself In Public.

   Previous month: [19]October 2023.

Books I’ve read

   Not much this month. Read my [20]2023 in books overview post to find
   out about the 22 books I managed to finish last year.

   The Malloreon chronicles by [21]David Eddings continues to be my go-to
   bed-time material. Books 1 and 2 are done and although the tension
   doesn’t exactly build up, I don’t mind to keep on reading as it’s a
   light read and entertaining enough.

Games I’ve played

   After finishing Super Mario Bros. Wonder, I continued with the 2D Mario
   strike with the Mario Land Game Boy series that evolved into Wario Land
   and Wario Land II. The best is yet to come, though, as Wario Land 3 is
   on my [22]25 Best Games of All Time list! I know them all by heart but
   still breeze through these platformers once every few years.

   My wife discovered a cheap Switch eShop code for Mario + Rabbids:
   Kingdom Battle and since I love tactical turn-based games, I eagerly
   dove in. It’s okay so far: the core gameplay is very solid, but
   everything slathered on top is not my cup of tea. I’m nearing the end
   and will have a review up shortly. Meanwhile, Kristien insists on
   playing [23]Railbound, a cosy railway puzzle game with sometimes
   devilishly difficult levels! Most of the time, I just don’t “see it”,
   but we’re having fun together nonetheless.

Selected (blog) posts

     * Gibru writes several interesting articles on AI and LLM generation,
       including [24]Contextualizing the Artistic Process.
     * Jonas Downey is convinced that having [25]side projects is
       essential for creatives, and I agree. This could grow into a
       powerful manifesto.
     * Cory Zue provides an overview on his side projects and why
       [26]building publicly in private works for him.
     * Keith McNulty explains why [27]the MBTI tests are corporate

       games.
     * This sobering article at Eurogamer reminds us that in the video
       game industry, 2023 was also the year of low lows and high highs:
       [29]You Can’t Talk About Games Without Talking About The Layoffs.
     * Glyph explains how to set up the best possible [30]Phython
       development environment for MacOS. Don’t use brew install like I
       did.
     * Speaking of Python, [31]why is Python so slow? Jake VanderPlas
       deciphers the Python internals to figure out why.
     * Vlad-Stefan Harbuz’s blog is great: it’s a combination between
       computing and philosophical work. Here’s his [32]overview on
       resources on the philosophy of work I still have to dig into.
     * Here’s an interesting piece on [33]Mickey Mouse and the Public
       Domain. As of today, one of the earliest versions of Mickey hits
       public domain in USA.
     * [34]You Don’t Need Statistics On Your Blog says William Woodruff.
       Perhaps I should take on the challenge and ditch GoatCounter in
       favor of a few grep scripts in access logs, if that?

Other random links

     * [35]Déjà Dup Backups is a Gnome-powered UI-friendly backup tool for
       Unix.
     * Did you know you can [36]Scheme in Scheme on WASM in the browser?
       wait what now? The Spritely Institute also has cool info on Lisp
       hackatons if that’s your jam.
     * If you want to follow physical video game releases, look no further
       than [37]https://www.physicalreleases.com/
     * The [38]Into The Aether Podcast released a six-hour long episode on
       the 2023 Game of the Year. It’s great, but I have been slogging
       through it on and off all week and I’m still just over 03:21:00
       hours/minutes in! Who decided that three-plus hours of jabbering
       about video games is a good thing? Because it totally is!

   I hope to keep up the blogging rhythm in 2024. That’s everything I wish
   for in 2024 besides the obvious ones.
