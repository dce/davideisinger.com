Just Dü It and The Legend of Link

Hey friends,

How many ears does Captain Kirk have?

Three. The left ear, the right ear, and the final front-ear. 🌌

Thinking Too Hard

This week, I've been thinking about specialist vs generalist skillsets.

I started my career in the web industry as a hybrid designer-developer. I built
what I designed and covered everything from UX to Visual Design to Front-End
Development and even some server-side logic. I was able to stay on for the
complete lifecycle of a project. Yet because of how WIDE the responsibilities
were, it was hard to be GREAT at all parts. There was too much to cover!

When I became a manager, it became clear that hiring generalists was even
harder. We decided to specialize and slice the design work from our team's
responsibilities. We had more work than we could handle and we needed ALL the
hands we could get. Specializing let us focus on being great at something and
more easily hire for the skills we needed.

Fast-forward to now and we're slowly climbing out of a tech recession. Business
is slow. RIGHT NOW it's valuable to have a wide skillset because the shape of
the work is changing — a flexible skill set makes it easy to fit into different
resource-shaped roles on a project.

So where does that leave us?

David Eisinger, Development Director at Viget, gave us some timeless advice
recently. He shared this quote from Neal Stevenson in The Confusion:

    "Pay attention, that's all ... Notice things. Connect what you've noticed.
    Connect it into a picture. Think of how the picture might be changed; and
    act to change it. Some of your acts may turn our to have been foolish, but
    others will reward you in surprising ways; and in the meantime, simply by
    being active instead of passive, you have a kind of immunity that's hard to
    explain."

David's point was that:

  • The most capable, most interesting, and smartest people: they want to know
    EVERYTHING, and find ways to connect them... So keep your interests super
    wide.
  • But be active. Even if it turns out not to be the right thing, doing
    something is better than nothing.

So cast wide, be active! [5]JUST DÜ IT! Even if the shape of the work changes,
if we're actively changing as well we'll be able to exist in those interesting
gaps!

Interesting Web Bits

  • A coworker of mine surfaced [6]Motion One, (which has apparently been
    around for awhile) but aims to be "the jQuery of WAAPI" (Web Animations
    API). I found WAAPI to be promising, but a bit brittle still, so it'd be
    interesting to peel this apart and find how they attempted to smooth over
    the rough parts of the API.
  • After yeeeeeeears, [7]Zelda is finally getting her own game. (Although it
    should be called the Legend of Link for consistency reasons! 😂)
  • Hugo Landau talks about the [8]demise of of the mildly dynamic website.
  • If you're looking to pick up a hobby, you could try [9]typographic knitting
    ... or you could just admire what Rüdiger Schlömer creates...
  • A really neat liquid physics demo [10]but with LAYERS!
  • If you didn't see it, Figma is releasing [11]a slides builder... but it's
    not base functionality. Gotta pay, yo.
  • Remember Hypercards? No? (They were before my time too...) [12]But someone
    built a hypercard simulator.
  • [13]Fun drawing physics simulator/game/thing.
