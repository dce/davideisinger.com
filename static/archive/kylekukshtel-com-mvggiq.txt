Cultivating A Space For The Doing

An average Tuesday begets strangely connected threads

Francis Bacon. Painting. 1946 | MoMA

Creative Meditation

Apropos of nothing I found myself circling the painter Francis Bacon today in
more ways than one. It started a bit with [11]discovering this piece on him:

    What would have happened to Bacon’s career had he been subscribed to nine
    podcasts? Had he been posting his work to Instagram, and Facebook, and
    Twitter? Pressure would have leaked from the pressure cooker and the
    violence of his work would have dissipated. We can debate how much the
    violence would dissipate, but I’m utterly convinced that it would have to
    dissipate—other things equal.

I’ve been working slowly in the background on what’s next after Cantata so the
notion of “sharing process” has been on my mind as a marketing technique. When
to start? How to start? Should I show stuff?

But this acted as a pit of a nice pill to swallow, this idea of sort of
cultivating your pressure cooker of ideas. In Bacon’s case it was his studio
(also some funny parallels here to my own online identity), but as someone that
has a full family now and no ability to just hide in darkness for hours, I’m
thinking a lot about the ways of making what’s next and how to cultivate that
sense of space around me.

I remember some really great photos from [12]Might & Delight’s studio:

It then seems obvious that the games they make look like this:

This isn’t meant to be some mediation on interior design, but just sort of
musing on both the psychogeography of where [13]the doing is actually done, but
that there is also a permeating sense of the creation (some may call this The
Vibe) that also needs to be cultivated as it shares the space between your mind
and where work is actually done. Cue [14]Bacon again:

    Engineer for yourself the smallest possible environment, concentrated as
    densely as possible with only the highest quality inputs; explicitly
    re-route all potential distraction-avenues back to one’s chosen craft, such
    that even when you’re momentarily doing something else you cannot escape
    the focus of your craft.

It’s almost a bit like making yourself a conduit for the work, and that it can
flow free into and out of you. That it can feel safe moving between those
spaces. Gentle thoughts will dissipate in loud spaces, just as loud thoughts
may vanish in quiet ones. Bacon’s art very much tuned to his studio:

The morning’s HN browse [15]then put this article on my radar (“Artists must be
allowed to make bad work”), which contains some video interviews of Bacon I
started watching but then realized I needed to get a lot of work done and would
have to postpone. Their own quote though is relevant to the “pressure cooker”
idea from above:

    There is a tendency in our society to be wedded to the new, to be wedded to
    the excitement of novelty. I think at the present moment that there’s a
    tendency — which I think we’ve got from America, and which I think is a bad
    tendency, to measure every artist by his last exhibition. “So and so’s no
    good, look at his last show!” The fact that he had five previous shows,
    which were very good, doesn’t seem to matter. It gets forgotten too
    quickly. And somehow the snap judgement on what one has just done, this
    kind of pressure it puts on is very dangerous, because artists must be
    allowed to go through bad periods

Again this sense of cultivation but also resiliency, that the practice and
doing (thanks Jay!) needs to be more about sustainability and craft instead of
practice-as-art.

I remember reading or hearing something recently about someone that was very
anti studio-tours from similarly articulated reasons. They sort of feel good in
the moment but are a distraction and start to produce weird forces onto the
space itself. From the earlier article:

    Bring in nothing but the finest inputs, and focus every possible
    attentional pathway back into the work at hand.

Studio visits are bad inputs. Social media validation is a bad input.

To quote the perpetually-inconvenient [16]adn:

    Game Quality is all that matters

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

From here we take then a final trip to our Bacon rodeo with a recent episode of
the 301 Permanently Moved: [17]Embrace Cadence, Find Rhythm. Again, very weird
that this whole sort of thought circle happened in the span of a few hours,
without me proactively following up on any of it. Just a few different
independent browse-seshes that resulted in parallel thoughts.

    Now [the artist plants] a garden.

    For it is there the work can flourish on home soil. Let their creations
    grow roots in persistent mediums. Deep soil of blogs and web domains. The
    artist can plant seeds here and watch them flourish. It is from this garden
    sheltered from virtual storms that the artist can do the work that
    transcends popular concern.

    Do not let the garden be overrun by weeds, The needs of retweets, likes and
    follows are unhelpful allies. Resist the siren’s call of engagement from
    beyond the sea. Pursue authenticity. Know thyself; for in the depths of
    you, the purest art is born.

    The work at first may flourish. Bear generous fruit, enjoyed by both the
    artist and the audience. But beware, however long or brief the blooming, it
    will lose its lustre. Guests will leave and once again the artist will find
    themselves all alone. They must return to work, sowing and pruning, finding
    fulfilment in the doing.

    Do not tolerate visitors seeking to grade and critique, for in ones own
    garden there is never best in show.

Happy Tuesday everyone!
