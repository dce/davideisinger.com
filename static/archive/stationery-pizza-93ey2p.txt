[12]Task management system: Analog Calendar

   2023-05-25 00:00

   My current analog calendar is a Hobonichi Cousin A5.

   I use it part for planning, and part for setting goals on different
   levels. Yearly, monthly, weekly and daily. I find it very useful
   process to do in order to see how busy things will be and setting
   realistic goals.

Yearly

   I use on of the graph pages in the back to define some goals I hope to
   achieve during the year.

Monthly

   On the monthly pages I make a note of the most important dates like
   birthdates and pay day and things like that. Plus that I use the empty
   area left of the calendar to define some goals and things I‚Äôd like to
   complete during the month.

Weekly

   In the weekly page I do a lot of the same. I define some goals for the
   week and usually write down a few things I really should get done that
   week. And in the week spread I write down appointments that involve
   others or require me to go somewhere plus where I am working from and
   if I have my daughter.

   Makes it really easy to plan and check how much time I have for stuff
   that show up .

Daily

   The daily page is probably the thing that change the most. In some
   periods it have been where I do my bullet journaling. These days I use
   them more to define the focus of the day.

   So the page laypit it is kind of split into two sections, one taking
   1/3 and the other taking 2/3.

   The first section I use to outline all the stuff I‚Äôm doing that day. It
   typically looks something like this:
     * Get up & dressed
     * Walk the dog
     * Pack my bag
     * Skateboard to work
     * Work
          + Work meetings
          + Lunch
     * Skateboard home
     * Walk the dog
     * Eat dinner
     * Etc

   Then on the big section I first define three areas that I‚Äôm going to
   focus on when I get home from work. After that I use the focus areas to
   define 2-3 goals/bigger tasks for each of them.
