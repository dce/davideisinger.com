[11] Task management system: Analog Calendar

2023-05-25 00:00

My current analog calendar is a Hobonichi Cousin A5.

I use it part for planning, and part for setting goals on different levels.
Yearly, monthly, weekly and daily. I find it very useful process to do in order
to see how busy things will be and setting realistic goals.

Yearly

I use on of the graph pages in the back to define some goals I hope to achieve
during the year.

Monthly

On the monthly pages I make a note of the most important dates like birthdates
and pay day and things like that. Plus that I use the empty area left of the
calendar to define some goals and things I‚Äôd like to complete during the month.

Weekly

In the weekly page I do a lot of the same. I define some goals for the week and
usually write down a few things I really should get done that week. And in the
week spread I write down appointments that involve others or require me to go
somewhere plus where I am working from and if I have my daughter.

Makes it really easy to plan and check how much time I have for stuff that show
up .

Daily

The daily page is probably the thing that change the most. In some periods it
have been where I do my bullet journaling. These days I use them more to define
the focus of the day.

So the page laypit it is kind of split into two sections, one taking 1/3 and
the other taking 2/3.

The first section I use to outline all the stuff I‚Äôm doing that day. It
typically looks something like this:

  ‚Ä¢ Get up & dressed
  ‚Ä¢ Walk the dog
  ‚Ä¢ Pack my bag
  ‚Ä¢ Skateboard to work
  ‚Ä¢ Work
      ‚ñ° Work meetings
      ‚ñ° Lunch
  ‚Ä¢ Skateboard home
  ‚Ä¢ Walk the dog
  ‚Ä¢ Eat dinner
  ‚Ä¢ Etc

Then on the big section I first define three areas that I‚Äôm going to focus on
when I get home from work. After that I use the focus areas to define 2-3 goals
/bigger tasks for each of them.
