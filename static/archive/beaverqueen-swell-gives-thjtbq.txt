WHAT IS THE BEAVER QUEEN PAGEANT?

The Beaver Queen Pageant is Durham’s own special mix of folly, pageantry, and
humor. Contestants take on beaver personalities: Fur Pelton John, the Beave
Whisperer, and Furrabella-Conchita Carramba. As with every Beauty Queen
Pageant, the contestants introduce themselves in their wetlands ready wear,
showcase their unique talent, and participate in an interview in their finest
evening wear. Beav Aldrin, the 2014 Queen, performed an aerial routine on
silks. Furrah Gnawsett-Major, the 2012 Queen, played the Star Wars theme on the
clarinet while hula hooping. 

[13]The Beaver Lodge 1504 organized a formal pageant in April 2005 to celebrate
a successful community effort by the Duke Park neighborhood to stop the NC
Department of Transportation from eradicating a den of beavers that had taken
up residence in wetlands north of I-85. Now, the Beaver Queen Pageant serves as
a fundraiser for the [14]Ellerbe Creek Watershed Association (ECWA). 

 

WHAT IS THE SCHEDULE OF EVENTS?

The 2024 Beaver Queen Pageant is Saturday, June 1st from 4-7 PM in [15]Duke
Park Meadow across from the dog park. We'll start at 4 PM with Pre-pageant
Activities (think fairy tails, etc, PARADE (4:45pm), and more!) The pageant
will begin at 5 PM. There will be activities for the kits, food trucks, a
lemonade stand, and a Locopops cart.

 

HOW DO I GET THERE?

The pageant is located in the meadow of Duke Park near the intersection of
Englewood Ave and Acadia Street. Please consider walking, biking, bussing, or
carpooling to the pageant this year! 

GoDurham Route 4 will can drop you off at the back of Duke Park (instersection
of Roxborro and Knox). There is limited parking available at Duke Park along
Acadia Street. Parking is also available along the neighborhood streets, we ask
that you please be respectful to our Duke Park neighbors!

IS THE BEAVER QUEEN PAGEANT REALLY FAMILY-FRIENDLY?

Yes, the pageant is a hit with kids of all ages due to the outrageous costumes
and fun performances. While there will be plenty of puns and double entendre
about the multiple meanings of “beaver”, it is usually far too subtle for most
young fans.

 

HOW IS IT A FUNDRAISER?

Our fabulous [21]business sponsors make generous contributions. Please support
them leading up to pageant!

You can make a financial contribution to support ECWA by [22]voting for your
favorite beaver character. Though the judges, also known as the Board of
Corruption, keep their selection methods secret, votes do matter when the
judges select the Queen. Every vote costs $5. You can vote online anytime
between now and the day of the event!

 

WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE BEAVER QUEEN PAGEANT?

This year is the Beaver Queen Pageant’s 20^th year. The event is uniquely
Durham: a mash-up of community, creativity, playfulness, and advocacy for a
cause.

The first event was held in April of 2005 in celebration of a successful
community effort by the Duke Park neighborhood to stop the NC Department of
Transportation from eradicating a den of beavers that had taken up residence in
wetlands north of I-85. Beverly Woody was crowned the first Beaver Queen
following an amazing clog dancing routine.

The following year 6 people wanted to compete for the crown of Beaver Queen and
The Beaver Lodge Local 1504 organized a formal pageant for the multitudes.
Celebrity judges and bribes became the norm. Since the beginning well over 50
people of many genders, races, and orientations have competed for the coveted
Beaver Queen crown and a uniquely Durham tradition has grown. The Pageant
typically raises about $25,000 for ECWA.

We’ve even had our first interspecies Queen: Miz Polly Nator was crowned the
2015 Beaver Queen and helped make Durham a Bee City. This national designation
raises awareness about the many contributions of bees and other pollinators to
the environment and food system.

You can watch previous year's Beaver Queen Pageants on the [23]Beaver Lodge
Youtube Channel.
