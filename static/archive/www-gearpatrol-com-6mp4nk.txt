tascam portastudio 414 mk 2 on a desk
Eric Limer

For the past ten years or so I've been a musical rut, playing the same
half-dozen, half-written songs on guitar once every other blue moon and
listening to the same handful of punk bands I listened to in high school. I’ve
been a musician for most of my life. Between church choirs, garage bands, and a
cappella groups, I’ve been involved in organized (but never professional)
music-making for the better part of several decades. But, after so long
uninspired, I thought that maybe the musical part of my life was mostly behind
me. Until the [111]Tascam Portastudio 414 MKII brought it all flooding back.

Released at the tail end of the 90s, the Portastudio 414 MKII harkens back to a
time before MacBooks shipped with Garageband. If you wanted to record music
with multiple tracks that could be altered independently, you were looking at
booking studio time or buying something like this lovely big blue beast. And
make no mistake, this chunky boy can deliver if you've got the chops. Bruce
Springsteen's Nebraska, a few early Ween records, and some vintage Weird Al
tunes [116]were all recorded on a Portastudio of one make or another. More
recently, Nine Inch Nails' Alessandro Cortini has been almost single handedly
responsible for making the 414 MKII in particular cool again with [117]his
unorthodox (and extremely sick) use of the device as an instrument in live
performance.

The 414 MK II lets you record four independent tracks to a humble cassette
tape, just enough room for bass, guitar, vocals, and drums, with the ability to
add more if you’ve got the nerve to "bounce down" multiple instruments to the
same track, irrevocably intertwining two rivers of sound to free up a slot for
additional recording. It’s ridiculously limited compared to the "digital audio
workstations" you can get literally for free today. but it does come with one
killer feature that has only truly emerged in the millennium following its
original launch: You don’t have to stare at a fucking screen to use it.

Much like celluloid photographic film, magnetic tape handles peaking more
gracefully than digital mediums.
Eric Limer
There’s nothing quite so satisfying is pressing play and feeling the tape start
to move. 
Eric Limer

I only ever recorded one (very poorly performed) song with my Portastudio when
my parents gifted it to me back in the mid-aughts, and for almost twenty years
I hadn’t really thought about it at all. But when an album cover featuring its
unmistakable visage cropped up on my Spotify, it lit a spark in my brain. Mom
knew just the closet where it had spent a decade plus hiding and soon, with a
package of fresh cassette tapes in hand, I was ready to hit record.

The Portastudio is designed to use pricey "Type II" cassette tapes for optimal
performance, but cheaper Type 1s work fine (or better, if you actually want
that telltale hiss).
Eric Limer

The joy of working in an analog medium, as [120]lovers of film photography can
attest, is both the friction and the flavor it brings. Light leaks can spice up
an otherwise average photograph. A little tape hiss can give your jam that
extra flair. The cost, of course, is that your mistakes get baked all the way
in, for better or worse. No undo buttons here. You have to move slowly and
skillfully to find success. And so my plan to record guitar, bass, and vocals
quickly hit a not-insignificant snag: I am neither a particularly good
recording artist nor a remotely competent audio engineer.

After a few hours of trying and failing to adequately record the beat-to-shit 
[121]Yamaha FG-335II I stole from my dad on my way to college 16 years ago with
a unidirectional dynamic mic not remotely fit for the task, I tripped and fell
into a whole other rabbit hole. What you really need, the gear gremlin between
my ears sweetly whispered, is a drum machine. Also a synthesizer.

A bit of research and a few impulse buys later, I was finally in business:

Arguably the cornerstone of Korg's budget "Volca" line, the Volca Keys has
old-school analog circuitry, basic sequencer functionality and limited
polyphony so you can play chords. It's also optionally battery-powered and I've
spent dozens of hours jamming on it while sitting on the couch. Oh also it
sounds fat as hell.

You have to assemble this tiny, digital synth yourself, but it packs a ton of
functionality into an itty bitty and affordable package. It supports [124]a
library of community-programmed instrument sounds and effects and doubles as a
capable FX pedal for my other gear thanks to its passthrough reverb, chorus and
modulation effects.

My Korgs all sport touchpad keyboards that are... technically functional. If
you want any sort of precision, an external MIDI keyboard is essential.
Arturia's KeyStep is a go-to choice that sports some useful features of its
own, like a sequencer for recording complex patterns and an arpeggiator for
auto-playing simpler ones.

It's not a drum machine, but I used it as one because it comes preloaded with a
number of drum recordings (and other sound clips) and the ability to load your
own. It served me well enough, but I'm putting this one back on the market
because I've made it redundant with some other buys and I've learned that I
much prefer synthesis to sampling.

Like any amateur analog artifact, this track contains mistakes encased in
amber. The hi-hats are too hot because I didn’t balance the levels of the
individual drums in my sampler before committing the whole drum track to tape.
The bass comes in awkwardly because I was doing dynamics live to tape with the
synth's volume knob instead of using a fader during mixdown. The solo, well, it
is what it is. But the Portastudio saved my ass, not (only) with tape hiss, but
by helping me take a deep breath and put this song to bed. I won’t waste hours
trying to improve on the raw material with endless tiny tweaks, because I
can't. Lessons (hopefully) learned, on to the next jam!

Controlled over MIDI by the Arturia KeyStep, the Volca Keys outputs its audio
through the NTS-1 for reverb before heading into track one on the Portastudio.
Eric Limer

In the months since that inaugural recording, the road of my obsession has
taken me away from analog, and towards digital devices that can synthesize and
sequence a song’s worth of instruments inside themselves (still no computer
screens allowed). At the moment, I’m in love with my [127]"Woovebox," a
petite-but-powerful one-person labor of love out of Australia, while I
simultaneously lust after [128]the wickedly slick, murdered-out Dirtywave M8
Tracker, a Gameboy-sized studio in a handheld.

If the two of us didn't go so far back, I might consider flipping my
Portastudio on the secondary market, where the prices are currently sky-high. I
could probably get more for it now than my parents originally paid and finance
a big chunk of this or that digital dalliance. But in a way, I'm glad to be
spared the temptation. Because if there's anything I've learned over the past
twenty-something years, it's that the odds are very high I'll come crawling
back to cassette.
