Favorites of February 2024

[11] 2 March 2024

My first month back in the software engineering industry as an independent
software architect is behind me. I’m still adjusting to the big change of pace.
The paper work involved to set up a company (besloten venootschap or bv) in
Belgium took longer than I anticipated and there’s still administration to do,
but at least my first invoice left my hard drive, so that’s worth celebrating!

I also finally managed to get my [12]Advice for Engineering Managers: Enabling
Developers To Become (More) Creative article published on InfoQ to hopefully
help drive sales of [13]The Creative Programmer. Yesterday’s talk at the [14]
Creativity Expert Exchange conference was also part of that campaign—the video
will be put out free of charge shortly (edit: [15]the concurrent session videos
are online!). I’m not sure whether or not it’s worth the trouble, but it was a
fun conference to attend with lots of talented academics researching the topic.

Previous month: [16]January 2024.

Books I’ve read

I blame the change in work pace. Again, besides the continuation of the
Mallorea series by [17]David Eddings, nothing much. I’m currently at Book Five;
the last one in the series. On non-fiction front, I still have Schopenhauer’s
work to finish that deserves more attention.

Games I’ve played

Same problem. I did finally slog through [18]Triangle Strategy, a pixelated
turn-based strategy game reminiscent of the classic Final Fantasy Tactics with
way too much cut-scenes for its own good. The game felt like an interactive
novel instead of a proper game, and although the alternative pathways make for
interesting replays, I never want to touch it again.

I bought [19]Balatro, a poker-like roguelike (a who-what now?) made by a small
team that came out of nowhere. It’s the perfect game to play in handheld mode
on the Switch in short bursts—exactly the kind of gameplay time I have
available. Considering I’m generally not a fan of roguelikes and taking the
randomness inherent to poker into account, I’m sure I’ll lose interest soon,
but it’s a lot of fun while it lasts. I’ll try to have a review up this month.

As for the board games played this month, I’ve dutifully kept track:

[20] [bggplays_f] My BGG Play Stats for Feburary 2024.

18 plays of which quite a few new ones, not bad! Three Sisters quickly became
one of our favorite “roll & write”-style games, and it includes dice drafting!
I’m using the [21]BGG Catalog Android app to keep track of things and hope to
continue to do so for the rest of the year.

  • For the small sum of $38.000, Wordpress will make sure your online legacy
