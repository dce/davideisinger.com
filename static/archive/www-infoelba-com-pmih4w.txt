Enchanting white pebble beach

   This enchanting beach consisting of white pebbles and shingle is
   considered one of the [97]most beautiful beaches on the Island of Elba.

   Just off the steep, white cliffs that are so typical of the northern
   side of the island, from Capo Bianco to Capo Enfola, the water in this
   beach is unique and unbelievably clear.

   Sansone is truly unique and enchanting because on days when the
   scirocco wind is blowing the sea is calm and crystal clear, and the
   candid white sea bed is like no other. Here you will find numerous
   rocks, grottos and gorges that are rich in brightly coloured fish, so
   they are perfect if you are a snorkelling lover.

   On the right hand side of the beach there is a rock that separates it
   from [page id="323=]Sorgente beach[/page], and it is very popular among
   teenagers who love to dive off it; on the left hand side the large
   cliffs are perfect if you love going on canoe and kayak excursions.

   There is a bathing establishment on the beach where you can rent sun
   umbrellas and sun beds, pedalos and canoes, and there is also a small
   bar.
   There is a restaurant in the campsite on the nearby beach of Sorgente
   as well.

How to get to Sansone beach

   If you want to drive there, take the main road from Portoferraio to
   Enfola and after about 4,5 km you'll see the pedestrian path on your
   right and the sign for the beach. Either park your car at the side of
   the road or in the fee paying car park, then follow the short path
   until you get to [98]Sorgente beach that, like Sansone, is a tiny beach
   made up of small, white pebbles. Since this part of the path is rather
   bumpy we suggest you avoid wearing flip flops which might make the walk
   down somewhat difficult.

   If you want to get to Sansone beach keep going along a second path,
   with the entrance to the campsite on your left, and go up a small hill.
   Once you're at the top of the promontory between the two beaches, go a
   little further along - it is a bit steep at times - and at last you'll
   find yourself at the beach.

   The beauty of the area more than makes up for your effort.
