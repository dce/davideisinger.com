Enchanting white pebble beach

[121][o_sansone_]

This enchanting beach consisting of white pebbles and shingle is considered one
of the [122]most beautiful beaches on the Island of Elba.

Just off the steep, white cliffs that are so typical of the northern side of
the island, from Capo Bianco to Capo Enfola, the water in this beach is unique
and unbelievably clear.

Sansone is truly unique and enchanting because on days when the scirocco wind
is blowing the sea is calm and crystal clear, and the candid white sea bed is
like no other. Here you will find numerous rocks, grottos and gorges that are
rich in brightly coloured fish, so they are perfect if you are a snorkelling
lover.

On the right hand side of the beach there is a rock that separates it from
[page id="323=]Sorgente beach[/page], and it is very popular among teenagers
who love to dive off it; on the left hand side the large cliffs are perfect if
you love going on canoe and kayak excursions.

There is a bathing establishment on the beach where you can rent sun umbrellas
and sun beds, pedalos and canoes, and there is also a small bar.
There is a restaurant in the campsite on the nearby beach of Sorgente as well.

How to get to Sansone beach

If you want to drive there, take the main road from Portoferraio to Enfola and
after about 4,5 km you'll see the pedestrian path on your right and the sign
for the beach. Either park your car at the side of the road or in the fee
paying car park, then follow the short path until you get to [123]Sorgente
beach that, like Sansone, is a tiny beach made up of small, white
pebbles. Since this part of the path is rather bumpy we suggest you avoid
wearing flip flops which might make the walk down somewhat difficult.

If you want to get to Sansone beach keep going along a second path, with the
entrance to the campsite on your left, and go up a small hill. Once you're at
the top of the promontory between the two beaches, go a little further along -
it is a bit steep at times - and at last you'll find yourself at the beach.

The beauty of the area more than makes up for your effort.
