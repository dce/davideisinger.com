How to Create an Effective Weekly Schedule

Have you ever finished a week feeling like your to-do list got longer with each
passing day?

Even though each day was a flurry of activity, it feels like no matter how hard
you try and regardless of how much you do, it seems impossible to make
progress. I can relate. And there were a lot of weeks this was my reality.

But it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had one of those weeks. And as a whole, they
have become a lot less common. I would attribute much of this due to my weekly
and daily planning process.

Every Monday for the past 5 years, I‚Äôve taken the first 15 minutes to plan the
week ahead.

For me, this has been my single greatest productivity routine. Before being
sucked in to the myriad of inboxes and notifications, I take a brief moment to
identify and plan what is truly important for the week ahead.

Part of this planning process includes accounting for the unmovable rocks in my
schedule. Meetings, errands, when the kids need picking up, the things I know
are going to happen on a specific day and time. These events act as guardrails
in my schedule. Hard stopping points in which I know I‚Äôll have to transition
out of ‚Äúget things done‚Äù mode.

With a framework of my week sketched out, I set myself to the task of painting
what done or progress looks like. First, what two or three projects do I need
to push forward? Second, what are the two to four tasks associated with each
project? And what does ‚Äúdone‚Äù mean? The more specific the better.

Targets

In every sport, there is a clear objective ‚Äî get the ball into the basket, hit
the target, get to home base, etc. Strategy and tactics may differ, but
ultimately there is clarity on what it means to win. That clarity allows for an
endless number of ways to achieve success. The rules and boundaries actually
cause creativity to thrive within their confines.

When we give ourselves clear objectives (targets) to aim for through planning,
we increase our ability to be creative. A lack of clarity leads to confusion,
inefficiency, and ultimately, frustration.

    When there is a lack of clarity, people waste time and energy on the
    trivial many. When they have sufficient levels of clarity, they are capable
    of greater breakthroughs and innovations‚Äîgreater than people even realize
    they ought to have‚Äîin those areas that are truly vital. ‚ÄîGreg McKeown

For me, the planning process gives me time and space to identify what is truly
important. This results in clarity of what needs to be done. That clarity moves
me to precise action.

Winning Each Day

Once I‚Äôve outlined my weekly plan, I turn my attention to the day ahead.

The same principles that guide my weekly plan are also true for daily planning.
Greater clarity on what I‚Äôm trying to accomplish leads to taking action.

This does not mean my tasks do not involve any level of ambiguity. Often in the
doing of something, greater clarity comes as a result. I try to remove any
guesswork for myself in planning out my tasks.

Instead of assigning myself the task, ‚Äúwrite weekly newsletter‚Äù I may start
with instead ‚Äúoutline weekly newsletter on restoring margin.‚Äù A smaller,
bite-size, specific task.

I‚Äôve found my limit is typically three important tasks (MITs) for each day. And
usually I only have enough brain power for two deep work tasks. Things that
require a large chunk of un-interrupted focus and creativity. If I assign
myself five deep work tasks in a single day, it‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll get through
three of them, and I‚Äôll finish the day feeling behind.

The real secret to winning each day has been planning my three MITs the day
before.

At the end of each day I review what I accomplished and compare that to my plan
for the week. Then, I look at my schedule for the next day and plan the two to
three tasks I will tackle.

All of this leads to a remarkable level of calm and responsiveness to my work,
rather than feeling frantic and reactive.

I‚Äôm able to be proactive in managing my workload rather than just surviving the
dog-pile nature of incoming requests.

The more I lean into the 4-Focus Method, the more I find it working for me.

My 15-minute planning session on Monday mornings has changed the way I get work
done. And thankfully, it‚Äôs rare to find myself absolutely buried on Friday as I
wrap up my week.

There will always be more work to do, but I know I‚Äôll be able to plan for it
when I‚Äôm back in the saddle on Monday.

(P.S. We‚Äôre re-launching our task and time management course All the Things
next month (May). üôå In which we cover weekly and daily planning extensively.)
