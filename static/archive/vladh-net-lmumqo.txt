Resources on the Philosophy of Work

   04 August 2022

   Wage labour is when you get paid a salary by a company to do work,
   thereby renting out your time. It’s not a good system because it forces
   employees to be exploited by manager-owners. This exploitation can be
   financial, for example if you get paid less than you produce, but it
   can also be something more than that. One often ends up in a situation
   where one finds one’s work meaningless, because one cannot connect to,
   own and direct one’s work in a hierarchical managerial workplace.
   Additionally, because wage labour is by far the most widespread method
   of organising work, one might feel powerless to attempt to connect to
   their work without having someone else own and direct it.

   Worse, even when one works 8 hours per day, the remaining hours are
   often dedicated to recovering from work and restoring one’s energy so
   that one may be productive on the next workday. All of these things
   come together to form something called “alienation” — our work is
   important to us, and we should have a positive connection to it, but we
   end up having a deficient and corrupted connection to it, which is an
   injustice.

   Some might say that this is unavoidable, but this is not true. In fact,
   the very idea of this system being unavoidable is a result of a bad way
   of looking at things called “reification”, which means taking something
   that us humans have made up, such as our economic system, and saying
   that it is actually real and inevitably has power over us. This is not
   the case because it is us who structured society in this way, and we
   could have done it any other way.

   Indeed, we know that it is possible to be creative without being
   oppressed. Most people can contrast alienated wage labour (what some
   simply sweepingly call “work”) with playful creation, where someone is
   compelled by passion and interest to put a lot of effort into creating
   something. In fact, we know that, ironically, we are usually more
   productive in this passionate state, than when we are managed and
   disciplined into doing something we do not care about.

   One might object that this view is naïve because it is not possible to
   simply do what we’re passionate about — there are many jobs that must
   be done and that are simply not fun. But the fact of the matter is that
   a very large amount of today’s jobs are entirely pointless and
   unneccesary. Instead, they only exist to provide a reason to perpetuate
   the status quo of wage labour.

   Imagine someone doing a job we knew to be completely useless, and
   receiving a salary for it every month. How would we respond to the
   proposal of paying this person their salary, but allowing them to
   simply stop doing their work? Many would react negatively and say that
   this person would be getting paid for nothing. But is it not concerning
   that we would want someone to waste their life away doing something
   which is never useful to anyone, just so that we can feel that they
   have thereby somehow earned their right to exist?

   Gradual change is possible, and a big part of this change is cultural.
   This means first realising all the harmful things that gross inequality
   of income and power does, then changing our values to say that everyone
   deserves to direct their own life and earn a fair living. This does not
   necessarily mean that everyone actually will be able to do these
   things, but the first step is recognising the current state of affairs
   as unjustifiable.

   Here are some beginner-friendly books and articles on this topic that I
   have loved, and are both eloquent and fun to read. I have also included
   some quotes that I feel explain these concepts well.

Introductory Essays and Books

   [49]“In Praise of Idleness” Bertrand Russell [50]“Bullshit Jobs” David
   Graeber [51]“The Tyranny of Merit” Michael J. Sandel [52]“The Abolition
   of Work” Bob Black

   The absolute best place to start is “In Praise of Idleness”, a short
   and very accessible essay by Russell that explains some of the most
   basic problems with our conception of work. “Bullshit Jobs” is a
   classic in which Graeber describes how many of the jobs we are
   currently doing are simply not useful to anyone. In “The Tyranny of
   Merit”, which I have found life-changing, Sandel describes how our
   conceptions of “merit” do not align with reality, and that our
   blindness to this affects our lives significantly. Lastly, “The
   Abolition of Work” is a classic and emotionally powerful essay by Bob
   Black in which he very clearly describes many of the problems with
   “work”, but this essay can also be too polemical and antagonising.

More In-Depth Books

   [53]“Another Now” Yanis Varoufakis [54]“Talking to my Daughter About
   the Economy” Yanis Varoufakis

   People often ask me what a system that abolishes wage labour and
   capitalism would look like. In “Another Now”, former Greek finance
   minister Yanis Varoufakis tells a fictional story that describes what
   such a parallel world would look like, and he goes into significant
   economic detail. Similarly, “Talking to my Daughter About the Economy”
   is an easy to read and light-hearted description of today’s economy.

Philosophical Background

   [55]“Alienation” Rahel Jaeggi [56]“Free Time” Theodor W. Adorno

   Perhaps you have read the more accessible material above, but would
   like to get more into the philosophical details. In “Alienation”, Rahel
   Jaeggi describes the history of the concept of alienation, and
   describes a modern and analytic way to look at it, which I find very
   useful. Her description really makes one wonder about the aspects of
   alienation that transcend the financial, such as its impact on our
   epistemic agency. Adorno’s “Free Time” is an amazingly insightful look
   at how work has profound effects on us not only during our time at the
   workplace, but also during our so-called “free time”, which the
   employer nonetheless deeply affects and controls.

   You can also read my somewhat amateurish essay, [57]“Alternatives to
   Wage Labour”.

Explanatory quotes

   Here are some quotes that I feel explain the ideas I have referenced
   above quite well. I do not necessarily directly endorse all of these
   perspectives, but rather find it useful to illustrate how philosophers
   describe these issues.

     We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody
     has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of
     us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all
     the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing
     this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of
     this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of
     drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must
     justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and
     people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The
     true business of people should be to go back to school and think
     about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came
     along and told them they had to earn a living.

     — Buckminster Fuller

     The ‘positive’ sense of the word ‘liberty’ derives from the wish on
     the part of the individual to be his own master. I wish my life and
     decisions to depend on myself, not on external forces of whatever
     kind. I wish to be the instrument of my own, not of other men’s,
     acts of will. I wish to be a subject, not an object; to be moved by
     reasons, by conscious purposes, which are my own, not by causes
     which affect me, as it were, from outside. I wish to be somebody,
     not nobody; a doer—deciding, not being decided for, self-directed
     and not acted upon by external nature or by other men as if I were a
     thing, or an animal, or a slave incapable of playing a human role,
     that is, of conceiving goals and policies of my own and realizing
     them. (…) I wish, above all, to be conscious of myself as a
     thinking, willing, active being, bearing responsibility for my
     choices and able to explain them by references to my own ideas and
     purposes. I feel free to the degree that I believe this to be true,
     and enslaved to the degree that I am made to realize that it is not.

     — Isaiah Berlin

     The fact that the vast majority of the population accepts, and is
     made to accept, this society does not render it less irrational and
     less reprehensible.

     — Herbert Marcuse, “One-Dimensional Man”, p. xliv

     The things of everyday life [must be] lifted out of the realm of the
     self-evident. (…) That which is “natural” must assume the features
     of the extraordinary. Only in this manner can the laws of cause and
     effect reveal themselves.

     — Bertolt Brecht, “Schriften zum Theater” (Berlin and Frankfurt,
     Suhrkamp, 1957), p. 7, 9.

The Story of the Mathematician

   This is a very short story used as an example by Rahel Jaeggi in
   “Alienation” which I find a stunningly good illustration of the
   problems I refer to.

     A young academic takes up his first position. At the same time he
     and his girlfriend decide to marry. That makes sense “because of the
     taxes.” A short time later his wife becomes pregnant. Since large
     apartments in the city are expensive and hard to find, they decide
     to move to a suburb. After all, life outside the city will be
     “better for the child.” The man, a gifted mathematician, who until
     then has led a slightly chaotic life, oscillating between too much
     night life and an obsessive immersion in work, is now confronted
     with a completely new situation. All of a sudden, and without him
     having really noticed it, his life is now, as it were, “on track.”
     One thing seems to follow ineluctably from another. And in a
     creeping, almost unnoticeable process his life acquires all the
     attributes of a completely normal suburban existence. Would he, who
     earlier ate fast food most of the time and relied on convenience
     stores for picking up milk and toilet paper as the need arose, ever
     have thought that he would one day drive every Saturday morning to
     the shopping mall to buy supplies for the week and fill the freezer?
     Could he ever have imagined that he would hurry home from work on
     Friday because the lawn needed to be mowed before the barbecue? At
     first he and his wife hardly notice that their conversations are
     increasingly limited to their child and the organization of
     household chores. Sometimes, however, he is overcome by a feeling of
     unreality. Something is wrong here. While many envy him for the
     beautiful suburban house he lives in, he is not really at home in
     this situation. The life he leads, which, as it seems to him, has so
     suddenly tightened around him—one could almost say “rearranged”
     him—seems, in a strange way, not to be his own life. Everything is
     as if it could not be any other way; everything happens with a
     certain inevitability. And in spite of this—or perhaps precisely
     because of it—it remains in a crucial respect alien to him. To what
     extent is this life “not really” his own? To what extent is he, in
     this life that he leads, alienated from himself?

     Each individual aspect of his life (…) has not really been decided
     on. Thus, his situation is in fact “out of control” in a certain
     sense, and (…) it is a situation for which no one can genuinely be
     held responsible. This does not merely mean that he has not acted,
     or has not availed himself of his possibilities for acting, but that
     he has not even understood his situation as one in which action is
     called for or possible; it does not merely mean that he has not
     decided something for himself, or has not led his life himself, but
     that he has been incapable of understanding or regarding it as
     something he can or must lead.
