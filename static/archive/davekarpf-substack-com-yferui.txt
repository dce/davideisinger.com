Technological innovation requires capital. A lot of capital. A giant pile of
cash.

There are, to a first approximation, only three places you can find of a giant
pile of cash. There’s government money. There’s venture capital. And there’s
big corporate R&D.

Of the three, I would argue that government is clearly the best. The reason is
simple: government funding doesn’t come attached to some rich asshole who
inevitably screws things up later.

Venture capital, for this same reason, is quite clearly the worst. Andy Baio’s,
“[33]The Quiet Death of Ello’s Big Dream” is worth reading on this point. VC
funding comes attached to VC revenue expectations. It makes unreasonable
demands. Sometimes they work out for the investors. They very rarely work out
for everyone else.

Big corporate money is somewhere in the middle. I’d classify it as eh, fine I
guess, so long as the marketplace is otherwise well-regulated and those large
corporations are constrained. (Which, heh, ofcoursewedon’thaverightnow.)

The examples of big corporate money that spring immediately to mind are [34]
Bell Labs and [35]Xerox PARC. There was indeed a time when big companies
invested a ton in basic science and R&D, with no immediate plans to turn the
results into products. And, as [36]Ian Betteridge pointed out last month, this
was because the big companies were rightly concerned about the antitrust cops. 
[37]A nervous monopolist is a (relatively) well-behaved monopolist.

Still, there’s a bit of elegance to the big-pile-of-government-money approach.
I first took notice of this with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act
(IRA). Fifteen years ago, everyone kind of thought that the only way to
jumpstart the clean energy transition was to institute a carbon tax or
cap-and-trade/cap-and-dividend system. (Basically, do some fancy tricks that
the economists suggested, then let the market work its magic.) Cap-and-Trade
failed for a whole lot of reasons, but one of the biggest was that the proposal
was complex and boring in a way that appealed to the economists but were
impossible to message. Most people were left thinking “this is probably gonna
turn into weird corporate bullshit, right?”

The IRA, by contrast, was just a big pile of money attached to industrial
policy — directional instructions for how to spend the pile. That’s effectively
all it could be, because of some vagaries in the Senate rules that let you
avoid the filibuster and pass budget bills with a 51-vote majority. And while
that big pile of money isn’t perfect, it is funding a lot of good things.

And of course we can scan back in history for plenty of other examples. [38]The
semiconductor industry and the internet were both built out of government
grants and defense contracts. We have sputnik and the space race to thank for
the computer age. The Human Genome Project was government funding. So was the
National Nanotechnology Initiative. Some of these were big hits, some were
glancing misses. But the general model of promising avenue —> government sets
up a big pile of money —> research and development flourishes in that area is
pretty well established. It works.

The are, as far as I can tell, only three downsides to the
government-pile-of-money approach:

 1. You’ll need to make the money back through taxes on the industries that
    develop as a result. And they won’t want to pay those taxes. And these
    industries will be popular, with a lot of capital to spend on pressuring
    government to give them special deals and tax breaks. So maintaining the
    equilibrium of establish big pile of government money —> industries
    flourish —> they pay taxes, which lets you set up the next big pile of
    government money is going to take constant effort to maintain. (This is an
    abbreviated version of Marianna Mazzucato’s [39]The Entrepreneurial State.
    Her book is excellent, btw.)

 2. The big pile of government money is tied up in bureaucracy, which means it
    isn’t especially nimble or responsive. This can be fixed through
    public-private partnerships and other administrative design choices. But
    it’s bound to be frustrating and sometimes wasteful. (Imagine if, circa
    2022, the Biden administration had set up a $30 billion fund for, like,
    metaverse research.) And that waste and frustration will be fodder for
    ideological opponents to the whole endeavor.

 3. The big pile of government money doesn’t glorify entrepreneurs and
    innovators as the very-special-boys who are heroically building the future.
    And that doesn’t feel very gratifying. They would much prefer an
    equilibrium where government provides the big pile of money, but then no
    one talks about it. Or gives the government any credit. Or taxes the
    windfall profits. It is not, in other words, a story that plays well at
    Davos. If those entrepreneurs get rich enough, [40]they’ll develop
    elaborate philosophical justifications for why the most important cause in
    the world is that everyone clap louder for them.

But those three downsides just mean that the system will require political
maintenance. It works quite well, but it isn’t self-sustaining. And this
observation extends beyond science and technology. The
big-pile-of-government-money is a return to how we approached public problems
through much of the 20th century, before it was rejected as “tax-and-spend”
liberalism and replaced by neoliberalism’s faith-based market fundamentalism.

The basic proposition is as follows: we should provide public funding for
public goods. Those public goods will make us a better, more productive
society. And then we refill the public coffers through a system of taxation.
The same approach can be applied to other public goods:

  • [41]There is no magic-unicorn funding model that will save journalism. It’s
    going to require public subsidy.

  • The crises facing the U.S. education system can mostly be reduced to the
    simple fact that we no longer fund public education like we used to. The
    idea that we are going to somehow innovate our way into a system that is
    both higher-quality and cheaper is as fantastical as it is flawed.

  • Ditto for higher education. If you think higher education is a public good,
    then you should demand public subsidy of higher ed. (Including, but not
    limited to, student debt cancellation.) If you do not think higher eduction
    is a public good, then that’s fine too. But you ought to go ahead and say
    as much.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The VC approach is the prevailing model today. And I have become increasingly
convinced that many of the problems with the current state of Silicon Valley
are rooted in the venture capital-class simply acquiring too much capital. VC
is fine (good, even!) when it is relatively small. But when VC is the primary
source of funding new science and technology breakthroughs, the whole system
gets skewed.

As it stands today, the primary direction-setter for new advances in science
and technology is “what do folks like Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel and Gary
Tan and Sam Altman find exciting?”

The problem isn’t just that these guys are ideological fellow-travelers, hell
bent on a shared political project that socializes all risk while privatizing
all gain. (though, I mean… that would kinda be enough of a problem on its own.)

It’s also that their eye for science, technology, and even consumer products
just kinda sucks. Building toward their vision of the future means we’re going
to end up with a lot of [42]silly investments in pretend-cities and [43]
eugenics vaporware. It means we’ll have abundant funding for hail-mary attempts
at developing cold fusion and geo-engineering, and practically nothing for
helping cities remain habitable under extreme weather conditions.

(Read Karen Hao, I’m begging you!: We’re [44]sapping all the remaining water
from the desert to cool AI data centers. It’s good for Microsoft’s stock
performance. It is counterproductive to the climate emergency.)

This kind of VC-thinking works fine under limited conditions, and pretty
terribly everywhere else.

Take Sam Altman. Altman is not an engineer. He is not a scientist. He has no
real training in either. He is an entrepreneur, with a flair for optimistic
tech futurism. He places bets on where technology is headed, and then attempts
to bend society in a direction that makes those bets pay off.

The previous generation of venture capitalists were, for the most part, actual
engineers and scientists. They had spent time in the lab. They had experience
being “close to the metal.” They made some real money early, then started to
point that money in the direction of funding audacious high-risk/high-reward
projects that didn’t fit anywhere else. The sector was small, compared to
government money and corporate R&D money.

Folks like Altman approach the future much like bad sci-fi. They begin from a
prediction of where they’d like to end up, and then work backwards. Altman has
faith that we’re going to end up at world-changing Artificial General
Intelligence. That means we’ll need transformative breakthroughs in chip
production and energy production. Ergo, he invests in cold fusion companies and
sets out to raise $7 trillion to build his own manufacturing empire.

That’s actually a fine approach, as private investment strategies go. (Hey,
you’ve got a prediction for where the world is heading, and you want to make a
bunch of correlated bets that support the prediction? Go ahead and spend your
own money that way. God bless.) But when it becomes the primary source of
funding for basic science and/or applied technologies, then the whole system
gets warped in the direction of a few billionaires’ speculative fantasies.

Venture Capital is not inherently better than government funding. That’s a myth
that was popularized during the neoliberal era. It has now become impossible to
sustain. (Just look at all the [45]stupid bullshit they fund and all the nice
things that they ruin!)

Big Tech only got so big because we stopped enforcing antitrust 20+ years ago.
If the current reemergence of antitrust enforcement has staying power, that
will be good for society and also good for Big tech funding of basic research.

But, most of all, we should get back to enthusiastically celebrating large
piles of government money, paired with substantial taxes on the companies that
flourish as a result. Government money isn’t perfect. It can be slow and
inefficient. But nothing is perfect. And of all the potential big-pile-of-money
sources, it is the one that does the most good, while putting power in the
hands of people who are at least supposed to have the best interests of the
public in mind.

        There's an old saying, "The customer is always right about what they
        wish to purchase." That is, people know their own needs. Being a
[65]    customer requires money. When the US had a growing middle class, they
[https] were the customers individually and collectively. We were able to buy
        all kinds of nice things. Now, the wealthy have all the money, and
        they're the customers for symbolic stuff, not physical stuff. So, we
        have a crappy consumer market and a wasteful efflourescence of venture
        capital backed crazes.

        "The basic proposition is as follows: we should provide public funding
        for public goods." However, public funding tends to involve taxation,
        and the rotten core of "conservatism" is myopic selfishness, so denying
        public goods even exist is typical of "conservatives". Moreover, the
        USA is so collectively brainwashed in this regard that even ostensible
        liberals often fall into thinking of public goods as if they weren't.
        For example, it's common to say things like "higher education is the
        single best investment that you can make in yourselves and your
        future"*, which may be correct as far as it goes, but it leaves out
        that education is foremost a public good, something we the people fund
        because it benefits all of us to live in a society where most people
        are well educated, to whatever level suits their talents and interests.
        So as a matter of realpolitik in the USA, good luck getting much
        traction with the eminently reasonable arguments you've presented here.

        "It's also that their eye for science, technology, and even consumer
[70]    products just kinda sucks." I'll be blunter: the guys you've mentioned
[https] are just kinda dumb. For example, Peter Thiel famously cheered for
        Candidate Trump but was disappointed with President Trump, declaring
        the latter and his shambolic administration "incompetent"**. Um, yeah,
        no shit, Sherlock. But the way Cheetolini governed, if you call it
        that, was perfectly consistent with his public conduct for decades
        prior. Only dullards were surprised. Evidently, Thiel is one of them.

        "The big pile of government money is tied up in bureaucracy, which
        means it isn't especially nimble or responsive.": Often but not always.
        In my experience, DARPA and NSF have been fairly nimble and responsive.
        It can be done!
