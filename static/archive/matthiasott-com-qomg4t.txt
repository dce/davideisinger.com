We all know that it is going to happen. It’s not a question of if, but when
Twitter will collapse. By the way: one day, Medium will follow. So will
Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Or Mastodon.

Many people are now desperately waiting for their Twitter archives, hoping that
they’ll arrive before all their content is lost for good. For those who were
using Twitter primarily for ephemeral chatter, all this isn’t that tragic. But
for others, all their posts, conversations, and connections on the social
network were a significant part of their online identity. They are about to
lose a place on the Web into which they put a huge amount of time, attention,
and energy.

Especially if you are a designer, an artist, a photographer, a writer, a
blogger, a creator of any kind, owning your work is as important as ever.
Social media platforms might be great for distributing your content and
creating a network of like-minded people around you. But they will always be
ephemeral, transient, and impermanent – not the best place to preserve your
thoughts, words, and brushstrokes.

In the search for a permanent home on the web, more and more people are now
rediscovering the personal website as a place to share and document their
thoughts and publish their work. [11]I’ve written at length before about why
this is such a good idea: Your personal website is a place that provides
immense creative freedom and control. It’s a place to write, create, and share
whatever you like, without the need to ask for anyone’s permission. It is also
the perfect place to explore and try new things, like different types of posts,
different styles, and new web technologies. It is [12]your playground, your
platform, your personal corner on the Web.

That’s why it warms my heart to read articles like [13]Bring back personal
blogging by Monique Judge on a site like The Verge or to add my site to
projects like [14]Bring Back Blogging by Ash Huang and Ryan Putnam, who
encourage us all to get into the habit and publish at least three blog posts
until the end of January. Oh, and if that’s important to you, as Chris Coyier
notes, [15]There Can Be Money in Blogging, too.

So how about we make 2023 the year of the personal website? The year in which
we launch our first site or redesign our old one, publish a little more often,
and add RSS and [16]Webmentions to our websites so that we can write posts back
and forth. The year we make our sites [17]more fussy, more quirky, and [18]more
personal. The year we document what we improved, share what we learned, and
help each other getting started. The year we finally create a community of
critical mass around [19]all our personal websites. The year we [20]take back
our Web.

I’ll start tonight.
