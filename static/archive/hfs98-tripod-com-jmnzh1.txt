                 (believe it or not), there hasn't
                 been a whole lot of HFStival news        [stars]
                 going around. Those pictures I took

                 damn cool the HFStival was, the      Green Day
                 Tibetan Freedom Concert, the only    Everclear
                 other big music festival in the      Scott Weiland
                 area, was CANCELED yesterday! Or     Wyclef Jean
                 delayed anyway. It will commence     Harvey Danger
                 today, but not without everybody     Fuel

                 article on the festival over on      Soul Coughing
                 Rolling Stone. You can check it out  Foo Fighters

                 [Sunday, 5/17/98] Well folks, it's   Cherry Poppin'
                 all over. The HFStival, which took   Daddies
                 place yesterday, was AWESOME. Sure,  God Lives
                 the temperatures were in the 90s     Underwater
                 throughout the day, and nobody left
                 without a sunburn, but it was okay,
                 because we could quench our thirst
                 with $3 Cokes! Yeah, the prices were
                 a little rediculous, but the music
                 was great.

                 The best performer, in my opinion,
                 was Green Day. While they aren't my
                 favorite radio band, they really
                 know how to work the crowd. At one
                 point, they pulled a guy out of the
                 audience and let him play a song on
                 the guitar with the band. They also
                 burned a drum set, and sang some
                 Maryln Manson. I really enjoyed the
                 morning outer stage bands, like
                 Fuel, Harvey Danger, and Fastball.
                 Wyclef Jean (say "john", dammit!)
                 was great, and so was Everclear, who
                 had the entire place singing along
                 to a couple of their songs. Scott
                 Weiland was different, but in a good
                 way. Foo Fighters were great, and
                 then, right before Green Day came
                 on, they showed "The Spirit of
                 Christmas", the original South Park
                 cartoon, on those two huge
                 television screens. Now maybe next
                 year they can look into putting a
                 roof onto RFK?

                 I took some pictures, and I'll try
                 to have them online in the next
                 couple of days.
