More Files Please

2024-02-27

Scott Jenson has a great article called [10]“The future needs files”.

    The power of files comes from them being powerful nouns. They are temporary
    holding blocks that are used as a form of exchange between applications. A
    range of apps can edit a single file in a single location.

Files as a medium of exchange between applications — I like that. It’s akin to
the usefulness of currency.

    The most powerful aspect of files is that they liberate your data. Any app
    can see it and do something useful to it.

Files represent a “data first vs app first organization”. If you’re planning a
wedding, you put everything wedding related into a folder. All your data is now
in one place vs. strewn across various apps.

Documents — like a Notion doc — are today’s folders: they contain a list of
links to “files” that will open in bespoke applications.

But there are drawbacks, like interoperability. Do we want to trust our data to
the success or failure of a single company?

    Files encapsulate a ‘chunk’ of your work and allow that chunk to be seen,
    moved, acted on, and accessed by multiple people and more importantly
    external 3rd party processes.

Can you imagine working on a codebase — which is a set of files — but the files
were locked to a particular IDE? Craziness.

Personally, I’m a file guy. I love files. And I wish more products worked in
the currency of exchange of files.
