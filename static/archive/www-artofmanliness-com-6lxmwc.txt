   Brett & Kate McKay • October 29, 2022

              Sunday Firesides: To-Dos, the Rent We Pay For Living

   You probably brushed your teeth this morning. And will do so tonight.
   And 730 more times in the year to come.

   As soon as the last load of laundry is folded, it’s time to put in
   another wash. As soon as you’re done eating and cleaning up one meal,
   it’s time to start making the next.

   There is a constantly replenishing supply of new texts and emails to
   answer, bills to pay, stuff to buy, bookings to make, forms to fill
   out.

   Whenever you cross one to-do off the list, you add a couple more on.

   Whatever you did the day before, you have to wake up and do it all over
   again.

   The relentless slog of life’s maintenance work can feel tiresome,
   burdensome, annoying.

   It can feel like you’re Sisyphus, pushing a boulder up a hill, only to
   have it roll back down, ready to be pushed up once more.

   Yet we should be glad to continually find this boulder resting at our
   feet.

   Drudgery and chores are the rent we pay for living.

   While we inhabit mortal existence, this rent is due every day.

   It’s not a fine, but a fee.

   A ticket to continue to ride.

   To-dos keep our world spinning, and signal that we continue to exist on
   a spinning world.

   We ought then to appreciate having one more task-filled day before
   there comes a knock on the door from a sickle-carrying landlord,
   bearing an eviction notice in hand.

   Yes, we should be very glad indeed to have a full list of to-dos before
   us. Because the only solution for clearing your slate of all unfinished
   business, lies six feet underground.
