James Shelley asks, [8]What’s the fun in writing on the internet anymore?

    To put any thoughtful labour into crafting words online today is to watch
    them get sucked up, repurposed, and often monetized by someone else. It
    feels a bit like a digital wasteland; overrun with pirates, replete with
    armies of robots regurgitating everything into a gooey cocktail of digital
    sludge.

Much food for thought.
