Looking at my logbook and thinking, “[21]Half empty or half full?”

[32]Hey y’all,

If you need some summer reading, the paperback of [33]Steal Like an Artist is 
still 53% off and [34]only $6.99 on Amazon.

Here are 10 things I thought were worth sharing this week:

 1. My kids love to use the slang word “[35]mid” to describe things that are
    “mediocre or of low quality” or “bad, boring, or inferior in some way.” I
    thought about the word a lot this week, and what it means to be in the
    middle of things — mid-year, middle age, etc. My slogan: “mid-life need not
    be mid.” ([36]Know Your Meme is still a great website for “[37]the olds.”)


 2. Took me five weeks, but I finally finished George Eliot’s [38]Middlemarch. 
    I’m not sure it was quite [39]my cup of tea! (I love [40]reading big books
    in the summer, but I don’t think anything is ever going to top turning 40
    and reading [41]Don Quixote.) If you’d like someone to talk you into
    reading Eliot’s masterpiece, check out Rebecca Mead’s essay “[42]
    Middlemarch and Me,” which she later turned into a full-length memoir, [43]
    My Life in Middlemarch. Eliot is a great inspiration for the middle-aged
    writer: She didn’t start writing fiction until she was thirty-six!


 3. “The nineteenth century didn’t think the dash on its own was nearly
    enough,” wrote Nicholson Baker in [44]his famous essay about punctuation.
    The Victorians loved the now-extinct “dash-hybrids,” which Baker named:

    [45]

    Eliot uses the “colash” in Middlemarch. (Thanks to my friend [46]Clive
    Thompson for pointing this out.)


 4. Eliot, by the way, is extremely quotable, and her contemporaries knew it:
    in 1872, Alexander Main published [47]Wise, Witty, and Tender Sayings in
    Prose and Verse Selected from the Works of George Eliot and later [48]The
    George Eliot Birthday Book, even though Eliot herself said [49]birthday
    books were “the vulgarest thing in the book stalls.” (A few years ago the
    novelist Adelle Waldman re-read Middlemarch and [50]shared her favorite
    quotes.)


 5. Speaking of quotable books, I tried reading Pascal’s [51]Pensées, as its
    influence can be felt throughout Middlemarch, but I eventually decided I
    couldn’t stand Pascal, so I picked up a similarly aphoristic and
    fragmentary book from my shelves — G.C. Lichtenberg’s [52]The Waste Books.
    Holy cow am I in love with this book! It’s the best bathroom reader ever.


 6. “The single most important question I think that one must ask one’s self
    about a character is: ‘[53]What are they really afraid of?’” RIP
    screenwriter [54]Robert Towne, who wrote [55]Chinatown, and doctored
    scripts for movies like [56]The Godfather. (He wrote the “[57]I never
    wanted this for you” scene.”)


 7. RIP artist [58]Anton Van Dalen, who was [59]the secret assistant of Saul
    Steinberg. (Here’s a tour of [60]his home in the East Village he lived in
    since 1968.)


 8. RIP calligrapher [61]Alan Blackman, whose “Letters to Myself” project is
    considered by some to be “one of the seven wonders of the world of
    calligraphy.”


 9. “How Hard Could It Be?” was the campaign slogan of the late Austin musician
    and writer [62]Kinky Friedman when he was running for Governor of Texas. I
    checked his Austin guidebook [63]The Great Psychedelic Armadillo Picnic out
    of a Cleveland library seventeen years ago before I moved down here. I
    picked it back up this week after I heard he died — it reads like a relic
    from another era. (RIP to another ornery Austin writer, [64]Michael
    Corcoran.)


10. Writing books, making art, recording music… it’s all a lot easier when you
    don’t know what you’re doing. Better yet if you don’t know that you don’t
    know what you’re doing. It’s when you know you don’t know what you’re doing
    that you’ve got to really get after it. Best to do what the poet Rumi
    advised: “[65]Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment.”

Thanks for reading. This is a hand-rolled, ad-free, anti-algorithm, completely

[89]    Thank you for sharing the news about Alan Blackman, a true artist of
[https] letters. My dad, now 93, was a calligraphy student of his many, many
        years ago. I hope he saved some of their mail correspondence!

        don’t know what you’re doing." So true.
