Ending my OpenBSD experiment (Almost)

January 4, 2024 · 197 words

I did [8]this fun thing from Derek Sivers because I wanted to play with [9]
OpenBSD and with [10]Vultr for hosting.

Well, I played with it. It was fun. I got to see how [11]Dovecot works and I
learned how to configure Relayd and the OpenBSD httpd server.

I think I’d end up liking it. BSD feels lighter and simpler and therefore
probably more secure than the Ubuntu servers I’m running.

However, I don’t need another server to manage. I don’t need to run my own mail
server or CalDAV server. My VPS at Digital Ocean has been running (::knocks
wood::) smoothly for years and I’ve got the configuration down.

I’ll be deleting the OpenBSD server once I’ve moved the few sites I’d migrated
there back to Digital Ocean.

Remember, [12]Reduce and Simplify.

I may try again later with stock OpenBSD and Caddy, without all of the Sivers’
stuff.

2 hours later: I was right. I spun up a fresh OpenBSD server at Vultr and
configured it myself. No services running but relayd->httpd and so far the only
site it’s running is [13]jackbaty.com. I like the idea of BSD so much that I
couldn’t give up quite yet.
