                     Ending my OpenBSD experiment (Almost)

   January 4, 2024 · 197 words

   I did [7]this fun thing from Derek Sivers because I wanted to play with
   [8]OpenBSD and with [9]Vultr for hosting.

   Well, I played with it. It was fun. I got to see how [10]Dovecot works
   and I learned how to configure Relayd and the OpenBSD httpd server.

   I think I’d end up liking it. BSD feels lighter and simpler and
   therefore probably more secure than the Ubuntu servers I’m running.

   However, I don’t need another server to manage. I don’t need to run my
   own mail server or CalDAV server. My VPS at Digital Ocean has been
   running (::knocks wood::) smoothly for years and I’ve got the
   configuration down.

   I’ll be deleting the OpenBSD server once I’ve moved the few sites I’d
   migrated there back to Digital Ocean.

   Remember, [11]Reduce and Simplify.

   I may try again later with stock OpenBSD and Caddy, without all of the
   Sivers’ stuff.

   2 hours later: I was right. I spun up a fresh OpenBSD server at Vultr
   and configured it myself. No services running but relayd->httpd and so
   far the only site it’s running is [12]jackbaty.com. I like the idea of
   BSD so much that I couldn’t give up quite yet.
