Your Blog Should Have an About Page

[11] 13 March 2024  |  [12]webdesign

The [13]site stats tell me that my [14]about page at /about is consistently one
of the most visited pages on this website. That confirms what everyone already
knows: people are very curious, sometimes even nosy.

I’ll be the first to admit that I’m just as nosy as my visitors: I love
clicking on About Me buttons as soon as I see one, and I’m disappointed when
there isn’t any—up to the point of me leaving the “personal” blog or not
bookmarking it in my feed reader. I want to get to know the person who wrote
that compelling article. What else keeps them busy in life? Bonus points for
cat pics, obviously.

The question then becomes: what to put on that /about page? Just your
professional history, making it more like a boring résumé, hoping the blog will
help you land a job? Your hobbies and coordinates? Your marital^[15]1 status? A
complete summary of the technical tools wielded and endless prowess showcased
when building your custom blog engine? A list of social media links where
people can also find you? How many years you’ve been uploading words onto a
server? A selection of the most popular articles you’ve written so far? A
lovely photo of you in a suit presenting something at an important conference?

I don’t really know and I’ve never been happy with what’s on my own about page.
For some reason, I’m not creative enough to come up with anything else besides
a dumb enumeration of things that keep me busy, mostly on a professional level.
Not everything needs to be put online. What I do know, though, is that such a
page should come equipped with contact information—preferably an email address.
I like saying thanks through email.

This [16]five steps to a perfect about page tells me I’ve been doing it wrong
for years: “The About page is the place where you get to sell your brand.” Ooh,
so that’s what it’s for! Perhaps I should go for some testimonials below a
founder’s story about a personal struggle, that’ll certainly attract the right
Brain Bakers. (In case that wasn’t clear: it won’t, and it’s a ridiculous way
of thinking about your about page. It’s a personal blog, not a soulless company
website that’s only there to further pollute the internet!)

Anyway. This post may serve as a reminder to go check the contents of your
about page. Is it still up to date? Does it convey an easy way to contact you
without redirecting people to social media junk? Is the goofiness level up to
snuff?
