   My highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the
   way we publish personal knowledge on the web.

   They're not following the conventions of the "personal blog," as we've
   come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles,
   displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like
   free form, work-in-progress wikis.

   A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly
   organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory –
   notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined
   or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will
   grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and
   less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

   It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer
   notions of how websites "should be.” It's an ethos that is both
   classically old and newly imagined.

A Brief History of Digital Gardens

   Let's go on a short journey to the origin of this word. The notion of a
   digital garden is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for
   over two decades. However, it's passed through a couple of semantic
   shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people
   across the years. As words tend to do.

   Tracing back how
   [37]Neologisms
   are born helps us understand why anyone needed this word in the first
   place. Language is always a response to the evolving world around us –
   we expand it when our current vocabulary fails to capture what we're
   observing, or have a particular desire for how we'd like the future to
   unfold. Naming is a political act as much as a poetic one.

The Early Gardens of Hypertext

   Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay appears to be the first recorded mention of
   the term. Mark was part of the early hypertext crowd – the developers
   figuring out how to arrange and present this new medium.

   While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet
   exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and
   more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.

   Let's note that Mark's graphics are to die for

   To put this in its historical context, Mark's writing was part of a
   larger conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext
   and its metaphorical framing.

   The early web-adopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a
   labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by and These creators wanted
   to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough
   signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.

   The early web debates around this became known as – the issue of how to
   give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without
   forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal
   struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure.

     "Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting,
     but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we
     may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and
     mosquitoes"

   While Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we
   face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging
   understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for
   exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a
   healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.

   After Mark's essay the term digital gardening goes quiet for nearly a
   decade.

Digital Puttering on Twitter

   In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet
   airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group)
   used the term "digital gardening", but defined it as "faffing about
   syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"
   Loading...

   The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people
   were using the term as a way to describe digital maintenance - the act
   of cleaning up one's digital space. The focus was on sorting, weeding,
   pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People
   mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as
   the focus of their gardening efforts.

   These people were digital puttering more than gardening.

   Since none of these folks reference to the earlier nineties notion of
   digital gardening, or mention issues of hypertext navigation, this use
   of the word feels like a brief tangent. Given the tiny size of Twitter
   in the early days, these people probably belonged to the same social
   flocks and were riffing off one another. It's not necessarily part of
   the mainstream narrative we're tracking, but shows there's not one
   strict meaning to the term.

   That said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are
   certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best
   enjoyed in moderation.

Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors

   At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered
   a keynote on . It later becomes that lays the foundations for our
   current understanding of the term. If anyone should be considered the
   original source of digital gardening, it's Caufield. They are the first
   to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.

   Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools –
   it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a
   different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information
   - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable
   space.

   Caufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by streams
   – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events.
   The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and
   InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive
   immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments.

   This is not inherently bad. Streams have their time and place. Twitter
   is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful
   encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn to play the
   game.

   But streams only surface the Zeitgeisty ideas of the last 24 hours.
   They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate
   information, or mature over time.

   The garden is our counterbalance. Gardens present information in a
   richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time. Everything is
   arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore. Think about
   the way Wikipedia works when you're hopping from to to . It's
   hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity
   trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered
   ephemeral stream. The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams
   and into contextual knowledge spaces.

     "The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the
     integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and
     rearrangement of things to one another."

Carrying on Caufield

   Good ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the
   personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay
   dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.

   In late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term
   more regularly – folks began passing around Caufield's original article
   and experimenting with ways to turn their chronological blogs into
   exploratory, interlinked gardens.

   Tom Critchlow's 2018 article was one of the main kick-off points. Tom
   read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to
   frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add
   campfires to the idea of streams and gardens – the private Slack
   groups, casual blog rings, and
   [38]Cozy Web
   areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens
   present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces
   to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.

   Tom piece was shortly followed by Joel Hooks' in early 2019. Joel
   focused on the process of digital gardening, emphasising the slow
   growth of ideas through writing, rewriting, editing, and revising
   thoughts in public. Instead of slapping Fully Formed Opinions up on the
   web and never changing them.

   Joel also added Amy Hoy's post to the pile of influential ideas that
   led to our current gardening infatuation. While not specifically about
   gardening, Amy's piece gives us a lot of good historical context. In
   it, she explores the history of blogs over the last three decades, and
   pinpoints exactly when we all became fixated on publishing our thoughts
   in reverse chronological order (spoiler: around 2001 with the launch of
   ).

   Amy argues that Moveable Type didn't just launch us into the
   "Chronological Sort Era". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge
   personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead
   of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the
   digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts.
   Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It
   became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML & CSS
   yourself.

     "Suddenly people weren’t creating homepages or even web pages...
     they were writing web content in form fields and text areas inside a
     web page."

   Many people have lamented the web's slow transition from unique
   homepages to a bland ocean of generic Wordpress themes. Digital
   gardening is part of the pushback against the limited range of vanilla
   web formats and layouts we now for granted.

   Over the course 2019 and early 2020, more and more people began riffing
   on the concept. Shaun Wang compiled the . Anne-Laure Le Cunff published
   a popular guide to setting up . The IndieWeb community hosted a to
   discuss the history of commonplace books, personal wikis, and memory
   palaces.

   By late 2020 this whole concept had attracted enough attention for the
   MIT Tech Review to write on it. Perhaps this is the watershed moment
   when a Twitter buzzword has "made it."

Digital Gardening's Fertile Soil

   What made our current historical moment the right time for digital
   gardening to take off?

   The timing coincided with a few complimentary ideas and communities
   rallying around personal knowledge systems, note-taking practices, and
   reimagining tools for blogging. The scene was ripe for new ideas around
   curating and sharing personal knowledge online.

   Many of the people who jumped on the early digital gardening bandwagon
   were part of communities like...
     * The collective – a group that has been championing independent web
       spaces outside the walled gardens of Instatwitbook for nearly a
       decade.
     * Users of the note-taking app – Roam pioneered new ways of
       interlinking content and strongly appeals to people trying to build
       sprawling knowledge graphs.
     * Followers of Tiago Forte's course which popularised the idea of
       actively curating personal knowledge.
     * People rallying around the ethos that encourages continuously
       creating 'learning exhaust' in the form of notes and summaries.

Developer-led Gardening

   Many of these early adopters were people who understood how to build
   websites – either professional developers or enthusiastic hobbyists.
   Any kind of novel experimentation with the web requires knowing a
   non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention all the
   surrounding infrastructure required actually to get a site live.
   Developers took to the idea because they already had the technical
   ability to jump in play around with what garden-esque websites might
   look like.

   The current state of web development helped here too. While it feels
   like we've been in a slow descent into a horrifyingly complex and
   bloated web development process, a number of recent tools have made it
   easier to get a fully customised website up and running. Services like
   and have taken the pain out of deployment. Static site generators like
   , , and make it easier to build sophisticated websites that
   auto-generate pages, and take care of grunt work like optimising load
   time, images, and SEO. These services are trying to find a happy middle
   ground between tediously hand-coding solutions, and being trapped in
   the restrictions of Wordpress or Squarespace.

   While developers were the first on the scene, plenty of writers,
   researchers, and note-taking enthusiasts have been drawn to the idea of
   digital gardening. To help folks without programming skills join in,
   there's been a surge in templates and platforms that allow people to
   build their own digital gardens without touching a ton of code. I've
   written an entire guide to
   [39]Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks
   if you fall into that category.

   Tools like , , and are all great options. Many of them offer fancy
   features like nested folders,
   [40]Bi-Directional Links
   , footnotes, and visual graphs.

   However, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter
   solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the and spatial
   layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made
   arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't "count,” as "real” gardens,
   but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't
   design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts,
   or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building
   materials.

The Six Patterns of Gardening

   In all the recent gardening flurry, we've run into the inevitable
   confusion around how to define the term.
   Loading...

   There are contested ideas about what qualifies as a garden, what the
   core ethos should focus on, and whether it's worthy of a new label at
   all. What exactly makes a website a digital garden as opposed to just
   another blog?

   After reading all the existing takes on the term, observing a wide
   variety of gardens, and collecting some of the , I've identified a few
   key qualities they all share.

   There are a few guiding principles, design patterns and structures
   people are rallying around. This amounts to a kind of digital gardening
   [42]Pattern Language
   .

1. Topography over Timelines

   Gardens are organised around contextual relationships and associative
   links; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's
   connected to others.

   This runs counter to the time-based structure of traditional blogs:
   posts presented in reverse chronological order based on publication
   date.

   Gardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail of a
   piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they aren't the
   structural basis of how you navigate around the garden. Posts are
   connected to other by posts through related themes, topics, and shared
   context.

   One of the best ways to do this is through
   [43]Bi-Directional Links
   – links that make both the destination page and the source page visible
   to the reader. This makes it easy to move between related content.

   Because garden notes are densely linked, a garden explorer can enter at
   any location and follow any trail they link through the content, rather
   than being dumped into a "most recent” feed.

   Dense links are essential, but gardeners often layer on other ways of
   exploring their knowledge base. They might have , , tags and filtering
   functionality, , , or listing notable and popular content.

   Many entry points but no prescribed pathways.

2. Continuous Growth

   Gardens are never finished, they're constantly growing, evolving, and
   changing. Just like a real soil, carrot, and cabbage garden.

   The isn't how we usually think about writing on the web. Over the last
   decade, we've moved away from casual live journal entries and
   formalised our writing into articles and essays. These are carefully
   crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it's
   done, it's done. We act like tiny magazines, sending our writing off to
   the printer.

   This is odd considering editability is one of the main selling points
   of the web. Gardens lean into this – there is no "final version” on a
   garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion.

   Gardens are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. When you first
   have an idea, it's fuzzy and unrefined. You might notice a pattern in
   your corner of the world, but need to collect evidence, consider
   counter-arguments, spot similar trends, and research who else has thunk
   such thoughts before you. In short, you need to do your homework and
   critically think about it over time.

   In performance-blog-land you do that thinking and researching
   privately, then shove it out at the final moment. A grand flourish that
   hides the process.

   In garden-land, that process of researching and refining happens on the
   open internet. You post ideas while they're still "seedlings,” and tend
   them regularly until they're fully grown, respectable opinions.

   This has a number of benefits:
     * You're freed from the pressure to get everything right immediately.
       You can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions like a
       good internet citizen.
     * It's low friction. Gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual
       that only takes a small amount of effort. Over time, big things
       grow.
     * It gives readers an insight into your writing and thinking process.
       They come to realise you are not a magical idea machine banging out
       perfectly formed thoughts, but instead an equally mediocre human
       doing The Work of trying to understand the world and make sense of
       it alongside you.

   This all comes with an important caveat; gardens make their
   imperfection known to readers. Which brings us to the next pattern...

3. Imperfection & Learning in Public

   Gardens are imperfect by design. They don't hide their rough edges or
   claim to be a permanent source of truth.

   Putting anything imperfect and half-written on an "official website”
   may feel strange. We have all been trained to behave like tiny,
   performative corporations when it comes to presenting ourselves in
   digital space. Blogging evolved in the culture of Millenialism as a way
   to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content.

   Weird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly
   crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns. Everyone
   now has a modern minimalist logo and an LLC.

   Digital gardening is the response to the professional personal blog;
   it's both intimate and public, weird and welcoming. It's less
   performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than a
   Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather
   than engage in banter and quippy conversations.

   Think of it as a spectrum. Things we dump into private WhatsApp group
   chats, DMs, and cavalier Tweet threads are part of our chaos streams -
   a continuous flow of high noise / low signal ideas. On the other end we
   have highly performative and cultivated artefacts like published books
   that you prune and tend for years.

   Gardening sits in the middle. It's the perfect balance of chaos and
   cultivation.

   This ethos of imperfection opens up a world of possibility that
   performative blogging shut down. First, it enables you to ; the
   practice of sharing what you learn as you're learning it, not a decade
   later once you're an "expert.”

   This freedom of course comes with great responsibility. Publishing
   imperfect and early ideas requires that we make the status of our notes
   clear to readers. You should include some indicator of how "done” they
   are, and how much effort you've invested in them.

   This could be with a simple categorisation system. I personally use an
   overly horticultural metaphor:
     * 🌱 Seedlings for very rough and early ideas
     * 🌿 Budding for work I've cleaned up and clarified
     * 🌳 Evergreen for work that is reasonably complete (though I still
       tend these over time).

   I also include the dates I planted and last tended a post so people get
   a sense of how long I've been growing it.

   Other gardeners include an epistemic status on their posts – a short
   statement that makes clear how they know what they know, and how much
   time they've invested in researching it.

   was one of the earliest and most consistent gardeners to offer
   meta-reflections on their work. Each entry comes with:
     * topic tags
     * start and end date
     * a stage tag: draft, in progress, or finished
     * a certainty tag: impossible, unlikely, certain, etc.
     * 1-10 importance tag

   These are all explained in their , which is worth reading if you're
   designing your own epistemological system.

   Devon Zuegal is another notable gardener who has epistemic status and
   epistemic effort on their posts, indicating both their certainty level
   about the material, and how much effort went into making it. They also
   make a strong case for as a feature, not a bug.

   In a similar vein, Shawn Wang has written the Digital Gardening which I
   adore and ascribe to. They ask the reader to allow the writer to be
   wrong, offer constructive criticism, and attribute their work. They ask
   gardeners to be considerate of others (don't share private information
   or name and shame), offer epistemic disclosure, and respond to
   feedback.

   All of these design patterns feed our growing desire for transparency,
   meta information, and breadcrumbs back to the source of ideas.

4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental

   Gardens are non-homogenous by nature. You can plant the same seeds as
   your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement
   of plants.

   Digital gardens should be just as unique and particular as their
   vegetative counterparts. The point of a garden is that it's a personal
   playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that
   match your way of thinking, rather than off someone else's standardised
   template.

   Ideally, this involves experimenting with the native languages of the
   web – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They're the most flexible and robust
   tools we have for building interconnected knowledge online. Gardens are
   a chance to question the established norms of a 'personal website', and
   make space for weirder, wilder experiments.

   That said, I should acknowledge that jumping into full-on web
   development is simply beyond the abilities and interests of many
   people. There is still room for personalisation and play if you're
   using a pre-made template or service – it'll just be within the
   constraints of that system.

   One goal of these hyper-personalised gardens is deep contextualisation.
   The overwhelming lesson of the Web 2.0 social media age is that dumping
   millions of people together into decontextualised social spaces is a
   shit show. Devoid of any established social norms and abstracted from
   our specific cultural identities, we end up in awkward, aggravating
   exchanges with people who are socially incoherent to us. We know
   nothing of their lives, backgrounds, or belief systems, and have to
   assume the worst. Twitter only offers us a 240 character bio. Facebook
   pre-selects the categories it deems important about you – relationship
   status, gender, hometown.

   Gardens offer us the ability to present ourselves in forms that aren't
   cookie cutter profiles. They're the higher-fidelity version, complete
   with quirks, contradictions, and complexity.

5. Intercropping & Content Diversity

   Gardens are not just a collection of interlinked words. While linear
   writing is an incredible medium that has served us well for a little
   over 5000 years, it is daft to pretend working in a single medium is a
   sufficient way to explore complex ideas.

   It is also absurd to ignore the fact we're living in an audio-visual
   cornucopia that the web makes possible. Podcasts, videos, diagrams,
   illustrations, interactive web animations, academic papers, tweets,
   rough sketches, and code snippets should all live and grow in the
   garden.
   [intercropping-garden_shrink_mx6nx8.png]

   Historically, monocropping has been the quickest route to starvation,
   pests, and famine. Don't be a lumper potato farmer while everyone else
   is sustainably intercropping.

6. Independent Ownership

   Gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one
   you fully own and control.

   This patch should not live on the servers of Facebook, LinkedIn,
   Twitter, Instagram (aka. also Facebook), or Medium. None of these
   platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal
   knowledge. Most of them actively fight against it.

   If any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with
   it (crazier things have happened in the span of humanity). None of them
   have an easy export button. And they certainly won't hand you your data
   in a transferable format.

   next to an open garden built on HTML, CSS, and Markdown

   Independently owning your garden helps you plan for long-term change.
   You should think about how you want your space to grow over the next
   few decades, not just the next few months.

   If you give it a bit of forethought, you can build your garden in a way
   that makes it easy to transfer and adapt. Platforms and technologies
   will inevitably change. Using old-school, reliable, and widely used web
   native formats like HTML/CSS is a safe bet. Backing up your notes as
   flat markdown files won't hurt either.

   Keeping your garden on the open web also sets you up to take part in
   the future of gardening. At the moment our gardens are rather solo
   affairs. We haven't figure out how to make them multi-player. But
   there's an enthusiastic community of developers and designers trying to
   fix that. It's hard to say what kind of libraries, frameworks, and
   design patterns might emerge out of that effort, but it certainly isn't
   going to happen behind a Medium paywall.

     __________________________________________________________________

   This is all my take on gardening, but knowledge and neologisms always
   live within communities. No one owns The Official Definition of digital
   gardening. Numerous people have contributed to the growing conversation
   and you should read their thoughts as well.
