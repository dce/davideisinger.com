A good assistant to your future self

Monday, March 20, 2023

[12][IMG_2886-600x600]

This morning I was flipping through my copy of the [13]Bicycle Sentences
Journal that illustrator [14]Betsy Streeter sent me and I was quite taken with
this final paragraph by Grant Petersen. (I’m a big fan of [15]his blog and [16]
Just Ride.)

He touches on [17]why I keep a diary, why I keep it [18]on paper, and the magic
of [19]keeping a logbook. The mundane details can bring back sublime memories,
and [20]what you think is boring now may be interesting in the future: “What
seems bland when you write it down… will seem epic in thirty years.”

I have a new studio routine where when I’m unsure of what to write about, I 
[21]revisit my notebooks each year [22]on today’s date. (I have notebooks going
back 20 years, daily logbooks going back 15, but I’ve kept a daily diary for 5
years now. That’s where a lot of gems are buried.)

Flipping through these notebooks will usually yield something worth writing
about. (This morning, it was [23]William Burroughs on language.)

Reading my diary this way, which I first learned from [24]reading Thoreau’s
diary, also shows me the cycles and patterns of my life.

(For example: [25]Cocteau Twins and the beginning of spring are somehow
intertwined in my life. What does that mean? And what does the fact that their
lyrics are barely understandable mean when matched with the Burroughs? Spring
is a season of rebirth… When babies are new, they babble and make noise without
language… do they sound like spring to me for this reason? You can see how
these thoughts, none of which I had when I woke up this morning, come forth
from just reading myself.)

[26][Screen-Shot-2023-03-20-at-11]

Another way to think about it: Keeping a diary is being a good research
assistant to your future self.

This is the advice that art critic [27]Jerry Saltz has tweeted over the years:

    [28]Be a good assistant to yourself. Prepare and gather, make notations and
    sketches in your head or phone. When you work,  all that mapping,
    architecture, research & preparation will be your past self giving a gift
    to the future self that you are now. That is the sacred.

    [29]I’ve never had an assistant. I am my own best assistant. My assistant
    -self is my past self loving my future self who’ll need this previous
    research when I reach for something in my work. My assistant-self has
    gotten ideas for whole articles, essays from minutes of research online.

    [30]Artists: The beautiful thing about giving yourself a little break & not
    working – those are the times when new ideas flood in from the cosmos & set
    your “assistant self” in motion, the self that will be there for your
    “future-self.” Curiosity and obsession always fill the vacuum.

    [31]Artists: Be your own best assistant. Do your research. Get your tools
    and materials in order. These will be the ancestors, spirit guides and
    self-replicating imagination of your work. This will allow art to reproduce
    itself in you. You’ll thank yourself during & afterwards.

I have my many moments of self-loathing at my own lack of progress, but one
thing I have done right, at least in the past half decade or so: I have been a
good assistant to my future self.

Joan Didion said of re-reading notebooks, “I think we are well advised to keep
on nodding terms with the people we used to be.” This is especially true if
they have bothered to preserve themselves so we can visit them later.

Yes, a diary is [32]a good spaceship for time travel: for meditating on the
present, flinging ourselves into the future, and visiting ourselves in the
past.
