BOOX “Palma” Phone-Sized ePaper Tablet

As much as we’ve loved eReaders like the [17]Kindle, the [18]Kobo, and the [19]
Nook over the years, easy pocketability has never been one of their strong
suits — not to the level of a smartphone, anyway. You might be able to cram one
into a pants pocket, but they’re really better carried in a bag most of the
time.

Not so with the [21]BOOX Palma, though. This perfectly pocketable (and
eye-friendly) device boasts unparalleled portability thanks to its
smartphone-sized 6.13″ e-ink display. It supports just about any ebook file
format you can think of, and at 300 PPI resolution, everything on it appears
clear and crisp so reading is never a strain.

The display’s dual-tone front light (which can be turned on or off as needed)
allows you to customize the brightness and color temperature to your liking,
allowing you to comfortably enjoy reading books, emails, news articles,
websites, and more under any ambient lighting conditions.

While the Palma looks much like a phone and does run Android 11 so you can
install and use apps from the Google Play Store — including audio-, music-, and
even video-related ones — there’s no cellular connectivity to speak of, only
Wi-Fi. However, it does have up to 128GB of storage space and an 8-core GPU
with 6GB of RAM, so it’s still quite powerful for what it is.

Depending on how much you’ve wanted to separate yourself from the continual
distraction a smartphone provides throughout your day anymore, it’s possible
you’ll find yourself carrying only the Palma as your primary mobile device!

Get the BOOX Palma for [26]$280 on Amazon in your choice of [27]black or [28]
white.
