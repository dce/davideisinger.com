There's still no silver bullet

a friendly reminder that you haven't found the panacea

   The late, great [30]Fred Brooks wrote many words about software
   engineering. You may have heard of [31]Brooks’s Law or read his seminal
   book, [32]The Mythical Man-Month. Even if you haven’t, you’ve probably
   heard at least one colleague proclaim:

     Nine women can’t make a baby in one month!

   This is a powerful metaphor for two reasons. First: it’s so vivid that
   it’s hard to forget (and easy to recall in a time of need). Second: it
   makes obvious a not-so-obvious conclusion. Which is:

     Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

   That’s a hard pill to swallow, especially when your project is late.
   But it’s a truth pill, which makes it worth choking down. Here’s
   another truth pill that Brooks wrote in his paper [33]No Silver
   Bullet–Essence and Accident in Software Engineering:

     There is no single development, in either technology or management
     technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude
     [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in
     reliability, in simplicity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   For those who don’t understand the silver bullet reference… it’s
   [34]pulled from folklore where a bullet cast from silver is the only
   weapon that can kill a werewolf. Over time a silver bullet has come to
   represent “a simple, seemingly magical, solution to a difficult
   problem.” Brooks could have easily reached for [35]panacea instead, but
   I think the shiny characteristic of silver makes it the perfect analog
   to software solutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I’ve found myself referencing this a [36]couple [37]times recently.
   Both of those conversations were in the context of [38]React, but the
   principle applies to every over-adopted technology.

   So, this post is a gentle reminder to my fellow software engineers:
     * Does a new tool promise to solve all your problems? It won’t
     * Do you think you’ve found the “one true tech”? You haven’t
     * Have a shiny hammer that looks great for hitting screws? It isn’t

   Please humor me while I [39]quote myself for a moment: (Hey, it’s
   easier than writing)

   IFRAME: [40]https://www.youtube.com/embed/btIc-_dGz9k

     We tend to be kind of lazy and just take the big hammer and hit all
     the nails with it. Like, “Oh, I’ve found the panacea. This is gonna
     solve all my problems”, because it does solve some of your problems
     big-time.

     But it’s also is gonna create other problems, and it’s also not
     gonna fit in every place that you can shove it. I mean, I know
     there’s React-based command line builders… And it’s like, okay, if
     you like components, cool. That makes sense. But why is React
     building your command-line app? I just don’t understand.

   When I extemporaneously said “I just don’t understand”, I meant that
   the choice confounds me. But I do understand why people might make it.

   Saying “use the right tool for the job” is easy, but actually selecting
   the right tool for the job is anything but. Good tools are hard to
   find, hard to evaluate, hard to learn. We have constraints, we have
   biases, we have shortcomings.

   But that’s all part of the work.

   And if you “just use Go” or “just use React” or “just use Postgres” for
   every problem that crosses your keyboard, you’re just not putting in
   the work.

   (And I say this as a guy who uses Postgres for most things! 😆)

   just use Rust, except possibly when you’re working with a platform
   designed for another language (e.g. web => HTML/CSS/JS, Android => Java
   or Kotlin, macOS/iOS => Objective-C or Swift, Microsoft Office macros
   => Visual Basic), though Rust does have FFI crates for all of these.

     Nine women can’t make a baby in one month!

   I quoted this to my wife once while trying to explain the concept from
   the book. She knew what I meant, but said (paraphrasing) it’s a micro
   aggression to pick out women and I might want to pick another example.

   After some reflection and an initial knee jerk internal reaction of
   “no, it’s a fine example”, I agree with her. There’s no reason to
   change the book – it is what it is, it was written at a point in time,
   and it did it’s job of getting the readers to think. All that said, we
   can come up with a better example for the present and future. I don’t
   know what that example is, but I know we can do better.

   How is it a micro aggression? I do not understand.

   Well, maybe micro aggression isn’t the right term, but it’s something
   that left a bad taste in her mouth and I’m trying to remember exactly
   how she described it. I think you almost have to put your self in the
   shoes of someone who 1) has had to work upstream in an industry because
   of their gender 2) has had to deal with people in a society that see a
   women’s “job” is to bear children and careers come second at best 3)
   has had to deal with a lot of people having opinions over your body and
   what you do with it, most of which do not share your anatomy. After
   putting yourself in that position, the comparison starts to feel more
   icky.

   I’ll be honest, I’m defending a view I don’t entirely “get” and may not
   be capable of understanding. However, after seeing her reaction when I
   said that quote, this is one of those times where I’m going to say “I
   believe you”. I’ve been incredibly privileged in this world as a white
   male, and that’s a pretty big blindspot, so I’m putting trust in
   someone else to see what’s there.

   I’m not going to fault anyone for quoting it and you have nothing to
   apologize for; Part of the reason that quote works so effectively is
   how ridiculous it is. I’m just going to challenge people to do better,
   and it’s going to be hard.

     when I said that quote, this is one of those times where I’m going

   That’s a fair stance to take, but it doesn’t produce much of a
   convincing argument that will drive people to change. If you want
   people to starting using a better metaphor, I challenge you to come up
   with one.

   “Over time a silver bullet has come to represent “a simple, seemingly
   magical, solution to a difficult problem.”
   Well, maybe - but what you’re actually referring to here is a magic
   bullet, or Zauberkugel. Over time, some people - yes, including
   award-winning engineers and scientists - have come to confuse the two.
