‘I’m not a cynic, I’m disappointed’ – the Software Crisis Easter Sale

Most people don’t realise just how few of the “critics” in tech are genuine
cynics.

You don’t spend a good part of your life shouting about bad websites or broken
software and how they could be fixed if you’re a cynic.

Cynics don’t believe things can be fixed and they don’t believe that fixing
things would help in the first place.

Somebody who is constantly pointing out various instances of software
inaccessibility isn’t doing so because they’re a cynic. They believe this can
be done better; they were optimistic enough to expect more; and now they’re
disappointed.

And anybody who thinks that pointing out common flaws in the tech industry is
good for your career is hilariously wrong. Dramatically pulls out his wallet
using only his index finger and thumb. Carefully opens it. A cartoonish moth
flies out of the empty wallet.

People who point out what needs to be improved are generally disappointed
optimists. Only an optimist would believe that pointing out what has gone wrong
could ever result in said issue being fixed. Only somebody who believes that
software could be universally useful to everybody in society is going to spend
time discovering and highlighting accessibility issues.

You don’t spend years of your life figuring out how the flaws of the web can be
fixed unless you think the web has massive unfulfilled potential.

We’re not cynics. If we were, we wouldn’t waste so much energy being hopeful.

But, people in tech frequently seem to believe that people like me are haters –
that we’re out to prevent the industry from doing amazing things.

That, the seeming slow progress, and the frequent setbacks get tiring after a
while. We’re only a quarter of the way through the year and I’m already
exhausted.

I’m not a religious person, but Easter is coming around right at a time when I
need a bit of a break, so a break it is.

However, being the eternal optimist that I am, I figure I might as well run an
Easter sale while I’m off on the couch watching movies.

So, until the end of day 1 April, the discount code EASTER24 will give you a
$10 USD off any of my ebooks. That means that you can get Out of the Software
Crisis and The Intelligence Illusion for $25 USD each.

And, yes, it means that, since their normal price starts at $10 USD you can get
the ebook version of Yellow or my essay collection Bad Writing And Other Essays
for $0 USD.

(Though, in the case of Bad Writing you have the option of paying more if you
want to support this blog.)

Not because of some religious thing.

Do it because it makes sense.
