Simple Commit Linting for Issue Number in GitHub Actions

   Including relevant ticket numbers in your git commit messages is a gift
   to your future self. Here's how to ensure you do it consistently.

   I n c l u d i n g r e l e v a n t t i c k e t n u m b e r s i n y o u r
   g i t c o m m i t m e s s a g e s i s a g i f t t o y o u r f u t u r e
   s e l f . H e r e ' s h o w t o e n s u r e y o u d o i t c o n s i s t
   e n t l y .

   I don't believe there is a right way to do software; I think teams can
   be effective (or ineffective!) in a lot of different ways using all
   sorts of methodologies and technologies. But one hill upon which I will
   die is this: referencing tickets in commit messages pays enormous
   dividends over the long haul and you should always do it. As someone
   who regularly commits code to apps created in the Obama era, nothing
   warms my heart like running [26]:Git blame on some confusing code and
   seeing a reference to a GitHub Issue where I can get the necessary
   context. And, conversely, nothing sparks nerd rage like fix bug or PR
   feedback or, heaven forbid, oops.

   In a recent [27]project retrospective, the team identified that we
   weren't being as consistent with this as we'd like, and decided to take
   action. I figured some sort of commit linting would be a good candidate
   for [28]continuous integration — when a team member pushes a branch up
   to GitHub, check the commits and make sure they include a reference to
   a ticket.

   I looked into [29]commitlint, but I found it a lot more opinionated
   than I am — I really just want to make sure commits begin with either
   [#XXX] (an issue number) or [n/a] — and rather difficult to
   reconfigure. After struggling with it for a few hours, I decided to
   just DIY it with a simple inline script. If you just want something you
   can drop into a GitHub Actions YAML file to lint your commits, here it
   is (but stick around and I'll break it down and then show how to do it
   in a few other languages):
 steps:
   - name: Checkout code
     uses: actions/checkout@v3
     with:
       fetch-depth: 0

  - name: Set up ruby 3.2.1
    uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
    with:
      ruby-version: 3.2.1

  - name: Lint commits
    run: |
      git log --format=format:%s HEAD ^origin/main | ruby -e '
        $stdin.each_line do |msg|
          next if /^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]/.match?(msg)
          warn %(Commits must begin with [#XXX] or [n/a] (#{msg.strip}))
          exit 1
        end
      '

   A few notes:
     * That fetch-depth: 0 is essential in order to be able to compare the
       branch being built with main (or whatever you call your primary
       development branch) — by default, your Action only knows about the
       current branch.
     * git log --format=format:%s HEAD ^origin/main is going to give you
       the first line of every commit that's in the source branch but not
       in main; those are the commits we want to lint.
     * With that list of commits, we loop through each message and compare
       it with the regular expression /^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]/, i.e. does this
       message begin with either [#XXX] (where X are digits) or [n/a]?
     * If any message does not match, print an error out to standard error
       (that's warn) and exit with a non-zero status (so that the GitHub
       Action fails).

   If you want to try this out locally (or perhaps modify the script to
   validate messages in a different way), here's a docker run command you
   can use:
echo '[#123] Message 1
[n/a] Message 2
[#122] Message 3' | docker run --rm -i ruby:3.2.1 ruby -e '
  $stdin.each_line do |msg|
    next if /^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]/.match?(msg)
    warn %(Commits must begin with [#XXX] or [n/a] (#{msg.strip}))
    exit 1
  end
'

   Note that running this command should output nothing since these are
   all valid commit messages; modify one of the messages if you want to
   see the failure state.

Other Languages [30]#

   Since there's a very real possibility you might not otherwise install
   Ruby in your GitHub Actions, and because I weirdly enjoy writing the
   same code in a bunch of different languages, here are scripts for
   several of Viget's other favorites:

JavaScript [31]#

git log --format=format:%s HEAD ^origin/main | node -e "
  let msgs = require('fs').readFileSync(0).toString().trim().split('\n');
  for (let msg of msgs) {
    if (msg.match(/^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]/)) { continue; }
    process.stderr.write('Commits must begin with [#XXX] or [n/a] (' + msg + ')'
);
    process.exit(1);
  }
"

   To test:
echo '[#123] Message 1
[n/a] Message 2
[#122] Message 3' | docker run --rm -i node:18.15.0 node -e "
  let msgs = require('fs').readFileSync(0).toString().trim().split('\n');
  for (let msg of msgs) {
    if (msg.match(/^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]/)) { continue; }
    process.stderr.write('Commits must begin with [#XXX] or [n/a] (' + msg + ')'
);
    process.exit(1);
  }
"

PHP [32]#

git log --format=format:%s HEAD ^origin/main | php -r '
  while ($msg = fgets(STDIN)) {
    if (preg_match("/^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]/", $msg)) { continue; }
    fwrite(STDERR, "Commits must begin with #[XXX] or [n/a] (" . trim($msg) . ")
\n");
    exit(1);
  }
'

   To test:
echo '[#123] Message 1
[n/a] Message 2
[#122] Message 3' | docker run --rm -i php:8.2.4 php -r '
  while ($msg = fgets(STDIN)) {
    if (preg_match("/^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]/", $msg)) { continue; }
    fwrite(STDERR, "Commits must begin with #[XXX] or [n/a] (" . trim($msg) . ")
\n");
    exit(1);
  }
'

Python [33]#

git log --format=format:%s HEAD ^origin/main | python -c '
import sys
import re
for msg in sys.stdin:
    if re.match(r"^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]", msg):
        continue
    print("Commits must begin with #[xxx] or [n/a] (%s)" % msg.strip(), file=sys
.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
'

   To test:
echo '[#123] Message 1
[n/a] Message 2
[#122] Message 3' | docker run --rm -i python:3.11.3 python -c '
import sys
import re
for msg in sys.stdin:
    if re.match(r"^\[(#\d+|n\/a)\]", msg):
        continue
    print("Commits must begin with #[xxx] or [n/a] (%s)" % msg.strip(), file=sys
.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
'
     __________________________________________________________________

   So there you have it: simple GitHub Actions commit linting in most of
   Viget's favorite languages (try as I might, I could not figure out how
   to do this in [34]Elixir, at least not in a concise way). As I said up
   front, writing good tickets and then referencing them in commit
   messages so that they can easily be surfaced with git blame pays huge
   dividends over the life of a codebase. If you're not already in the
   habit of doing this, well, the best time to start was Initial commit,
   but the second best time is today.
