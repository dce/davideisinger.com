You Can Slow Down Time

   Gears

   “Where does the time go?” We've all asked this at one time or another
   and it only gets more common the older you get. Remember how long
   holiday breaks or summer vacation felt like when we were kids? Now, we
   leave the office on a Friday evening only to be jolted into the
   realization that it's now Sunday night and we barely recall anything
   from the weekend. Entire years seem to speed by so fast nowadays,
   right?
   Gears

   This perception of time moving at a leisurely pace in childhood, and
   then quickening as we become adults, is a common experience, according
   to neuroscientists. It's due to a few factors, says [29]Dr. Santosh
   Kesari, a board-certified neurologist and director of Neuro-oncology at
   Pacific Neuroscience Institute.

   First of all, when we're children, a year of life amounts to much more
   time of existence, percentage-wise. "For a 10-year-old, one year is 10
   percent of their lives," says Kesari. "For a 60-year-old, one year is
   less than two percent of their lives." But more importantly, we're
   constantly being introduced to new things and ideas when we're young
   that leave lasting impressions on our memories. "We gauge time by
   memorable events and fewer new things occur as we age to remember," he
   says. "And this makes it seem like childhood lasted longer."

   Which means by paying attention, staying curious and actively noticing
   new things, we can slow down our perception of time. David Eagleman, a
   neuroscientist who studies time perception, was profiled in [30]The New
   Yorker and called time "a rubbery thing" that changes based on mental
   engagement.

   "Time stretches out when you really turn your brain resources on, and
   when you say, 'Oh, I got this, everything is as expected,' it shrinks
   up," he explained. "The more familiar the world becomes, the less
   information your brain writes down, and the more quickly time seems to
   pass." Here are three ways to make your life richer and more memorable,
   thus allowing your time to expand.

Embrace New Experiences

   Routines are necessary in life but are the enemy when it comes to
   extending time. As we touched on previously, the lack of new
   experiences is what makes time appear to speed up, so introducing
   novelty into your life is the key to slowing down your perception of
   time. By trying new things—accepting invitations and challenges or
   learning a new skill or hobby—this will form "accessible memory
   anchors," as a neurologist might put it. It's as simple as switching up
   your coffee order or getting a few coworkers to try a new place for
   lunch or afterwork drinks.

Be More Mindful

   In the past few years, there has been a lot of talk about mindfulness.
   But it's often in the context of [31]meditation. In terms of slowing
   down time, you don't necessarily need to start each day meditating.
   Instead, you'll want to become more mindful in everyday life. Meaning
   you'll want to focus all your attention and energy to what you're
   doing, seeing and experiencing right now. Instead of multi-tasking and
   doing three things at once, try to be fully engrossed in what's right
   in front of you. A [32]study by Harvard Medical School found that those
   in an eight-week mindfulness-based program experienced changes in the
   concentration of gray matter areas in the brain responsible for
   learning, memory and emotion regulation.

Keep Track of Progress

   We've extolled the virtues of [33]journaling before. But it definitely
   comes in handy to help you slow time by taking time to reflect on your
   day, your thoughts and your personal progress. It provides the context
   to make life events relevant, and more importantly, memorable. That
   context is key. A [34]study by the Wharton School found that we
   underestimate the passage of time—especially when there aren't related
   memories to build upon knowledge. It illustrated why you can feel
   regretful when another birthday rolls around too quickly. Journaling
   and tracking your progress will ensure you don't feel unaccomplished.
   The positive byproduct is that accountability will also serve as
   motivation to do more.

   according to the [36]Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
