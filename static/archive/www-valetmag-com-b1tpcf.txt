You Can Slow Down Time

“Where does the time go?” We've all asked this at one time or another and it
only gets more common the older you get. Remember how long holiday breaks or
summer vacation felt like when we were kids? Now, we leave the office on a
Friday evening only to be jolted into the realization that it's now Sunday
night and we barely recall anything from the weekend. Entire years seem to
speed by so fast nowadays, right?

This perception of time moving at a leisurely pace in childhood, and then
quickening as we become adults, is a common experience, according to
neuroscientists. It's due to a few factors, says [40]Dr. Santosh Kesari, a
board-certified neurologist and director of Neuro-oncology at Pacific
Neuroscience Institute.

First of all, when we're children, a year of life amounts to much more time of
existence, percentage-wise. "For a 10-year-old, one year is 10 percent of their
lives," says Kesari. "For a 60-year-old, one year is less than two percent of
their lives." But more importantly, we're constantly being introduced to new
things and ideas when we're young that leave lasting impressions on our
memories. "We gauge time by memorable events and fewer new things occur as we
age to remember," he says. "And this makes it seem like childhood lasted
longer."

Which means by paying attention, staying curious and actively noticing new
things, we can slow down our perception of time. David Eagleman, a
neuroscientist who studies time perception, was profiled in [41]The New Yorker
and called time "a rubbery thing" that changes based on mental engagement.

"Time stretches out when you really turn your brain resources on, and when you
say, 'Oh, I got this, everything is as expected,' it shrinks up," he explained.
"The more familiar the world becomes, the less information your brain writes
down, and the more quickly time seems to pass." Here are three ways to make
your life richer and more memorable, thus allowing your time to expand.

Embrace New Experiences

Routines are necessary in life but are the enemy when it comes to extending
time. As we touched on previously, the lack of new experiences is what makes
time appear to speed up, so introducing novelty into your life is the key to
slowing down your perception of time. By trying new things—accepting
invitations and challenges or learning a new skill or hobby—this will form
"accessible memory anchors," as a neurologist might put it. It's as simple as
switching up your coffee order or getting a few coworkers to try a new place
for lunch or afterwork drinks.

Be More Mindful

In the past few years, there has been a lot of talk about mindfulness. But it's
often in the context of [42]meditation. In terms of slowing down time, you
don't necessarily need to start each day meditating. Instead, you'll want to
become more mindful in everyday life. Meaning you'll want to focus all your
attention and energy to what you're doing, seeing and experiencing right now.
Instead of multi-tasking and doing three things at once, try to be fully
engrossed in what's right in front of you. A [43]study by Harvard Medical
School found that those in an eight-week mindfulness-based program experienced
changes in the concentration of gray matter areas in the brain responsible for
learning, memory and emotion regulation.

Keep Track of Progress

We've extolled the virtues of [44]journaling before. But it definitely comes in
handy to help you slow time by taking time to reflect on your day, your
thoughts and your personal progress. It provides the context to make life
events relevant, and more importantly, memorable. That context is key. A [45]
study by the Wharton School found that we underestimate the passage of
time—especially when there aren't related memories to build upon knowledge. It
illustrated why you can feel regretful when another birthday rolls around too
quickly. Journaling and tracking your progress will ensure you don't feel
unaccomplished. The positive byproduct is that accountability will also serve
as motivation to do more.

FYI

The average life expectancy in the United States is 78.6 years, according to
the [47]Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
